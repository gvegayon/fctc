"6","Australia","Tobacco Plain Packaging
All tobacco products manufactured or packaged in Australia for domestic consumption were required to be in plain packaging. effective 1 October 2012. and all tobacco products were required to be sold in plain packaging effective 
1 December 2012. 
The objectives of the plain packaging measure are to:
– reduce the appeal of tobacco products to consumers. particularly young people;
– increase the effectiveness of mandated health warnings;
– reduce the ability of the retail packaging of tobacco products to mislead consumers about the harmful effects of smoking or using tobacco products; and
– through the achievement of these aims in the long term. as part of a comprehensive suite of tobacco control measures. contribute to efforts to reduce smoking rates.
Tobacco plain packaging is being implemented through the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 and the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Act 2011. 
The legislation prohibits tobacco industry logos. brand imagery. colours and promotional text other than brand and product names in a standard colour. position. font style and size on retail packaging of tobacco products. 
Tobacco product retail packaging is required to appear in a drab dark brown colour in matt finish. Cigarette packs are required to have standardised shapes and openings. Plain packaging applies not just to cigarette products but to all tobacco products. including loose leaf tobacco. cigars and bidis. Some restrictions also apply to the appearance of tobacco products.
Graphic Health Warnings
Graphic health warnings on tobacco products have been updated and expanded in the Competition and Consumer (Tobacco) Information Standard 2011 (the Standard) which commenced on 1 January 2012 and took full effect from 1 December 2012. The requirments are as follows
– The size of graphic health warnings increased to 75 per cent of the front of the pack for cigarettes and cartons. up from 30 per cent. with the 90 per cent warnings for the back of packs retained.
– The size of graphic health warnings for most other smoked tobacco products has increased to 75 per cent of both the front and back of the pack.
– Cigars sold singly are also required to have health warnings under the Standard. 
– The graphic health warnings for cigarettes and most other smoked tobacco products (not including cigars and bidis) rotate in two sets of seven warnings every 12 months.
– Information messages about the toxic chemicals in tobacco smoke and their health effects are paired to each of the 14 warnings and are required on the side of cigarette packaging and on other panels of most other smoked tobacco products (not including cigars and bidis). 
In relation to questions 3.2.5.11 and 3.2.5.12. the Australian Government owns copyright for some but not all of the images used as graphic health warnings on tobacco product packaging in Australia. Australia grants copyright licences to other Parties for use of the images owned by the Australian Government. or where the Australian Government is permitted to sublicense the use of an externally owned image. In the case of some images not owned by the Australian Government. permission may need to be sought from an external copyright owner and may include a fee.","On 29 April 2010 the Australian Government announced its decision to implement plain packaging for tobacco products and to mandate updated and expanded graphic health warnings. 
Plain packaging is being implemented through the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 and the Trade Marks Amendment (Tobacco Plain Packaging) Act 2011. The legislation prohibits tobacco industry logos brand imagery colours and promotional text other than brand and product names in a standard colour position font style and size. Tobacco product retail packaging will be required to appear in a drab dark brown colour in matt finish and with standardised shapes and openings. Plain packaging will be applied to all tobacco products including loose leaf tobacco cigars and bidis. 
All tobacco products manufactured or packaged in Australia from 1 October 2012 for domestic consumption will be required to be in plain packaging and all tobacco products will be required to be sold in plain packaging by 1 December 2012. The objectives of the plain packaging measure are to:
- reduce the attractiveness and appeal of tobacco products to consumers particularly young people;
- increase the noticeability and effectiveness of mandated health warnings;
- reduce the ability of the retail packaging of tobacco products to mislead consumers about the harms of smoking; and
- through the achievement of these aims in the long term as part of a comprehensive suite of tobacco control measures contribute to efforts to reduce smoking rates.
On 1 January 2012 the Competition and Consumer (Tobacco) Information Standard 2011 (the Standard) commenced updating and expanding the graphic health warnings required on most tobacco product packaging since 1 March 2006. The key changes to the graphic health warning requirements are:
- the size of graphic health warnings will increase to 75 per cent of the front of the pack for cigarettes and cartons with the current 90 per cent warnings for the back of packs retained;
- the size of graphic health warnings for most other smoked tobacco products will increase to 75 per cent of both the front and back of the pack; and
- single-sale cigars will no longer be exempt from displaying health warnings.
International guidelines scientific evidence current research the experience of other countries and a program of market research informed the development of the new graphic health warning requirements. Further information on plain packaging and graphic health warnings including the program of market research can be found online at www.yourhealth.gov.au. The legislation can be accessed at www.comlaw.gov.au.
As part of updating and expanding the graphic health warnings Australia has also updated its side of pack tobacco product warnings containing information about the toxic chemicals in tobacco smoke and their health effects. Further information is at section 3.2.4 above.

There are 16 different health warnings which are randomly available at point of sale locations. These will effectively rotate health warnings for cigarettes and little cigars.
Under the previous labelling requirements in the Tobacco Product Information Regulations. the toxic emissions statements displayed numerical values for six toxic emissions (tar. nicotine. carbon monoxide. formaldehyde. hydrogen cyanide and benzene). However. research conducted by Health Canada has shown that the numerical values were not clearly understood by some smokers and most had little idea what the range of numbers displayed for each chemical meant. Therefore. the numerical values have been replaced by four text-based statements that provide clear. concise and easy to understand information about the toxic substances found in tobacco smoke.","The Tobacco Products Labelling Regulations (Cigarettes and Little Cigars) (TPLR-CLC) came into force in September 2011 and define new health-related labelling requirements for packages of cigarettes and little cigars intended for retail sale in Canada.

En la ronda de advertencias actual se incluyó la advertencia fumar puede causar cáncer de mama. con su respectivo pictograma. la IT se mostró muy insatisfecha con el diseño. amenazó con demandar al MINSA. sin embargo aplicando el principio de precautoriedad la advertencia circuló durante toda la vigencia de la ronda.
Se participó con el el Dr. Ernesto Sebrié del Roswell Park Institute en un estudio centroamericano de validación de las advertencias con la finalidad de seleccionar las imágenes que mayor impacto tuvieran entre los entrevistados. A la fecha el estudio está en fase de análisis de data.","En el mes de junio Panamá inicia la IV ronda de advertencias entre las que se incluyen los siguientes mensajes sanitarios:

Fumar puede Causar Impotencia

Actualmente circulan 5 advertencias y sus pictogramas como parte de la segunda ronda las cuales se ubican en el 50% de las caras principales del empaquetado se ha prohibido el uso de terminos engañosos y se reportan pero no se cuantifican en el empaquetado algunos contenidos y emisiones de los productos de tabaco. Las mismas deben colocarse en el empaquetado de todos los productos de tabaco. A la fecha esta disposición se cumple fundamentalmente en los paquetes de cigarrillos y cigarros existen limitaciones para su colocación en los envases de otros productos de tabaco. Durante la primera y segunda ronda hemos utilizado una combinación de advertencias y pictogramas nacionales y otras facilitadas por OPS u otros países. Estamos preparando la tercera ronda que deberá estar en los empaquetados y etiquetados en un término de 9 meses.
Hemos realizado una valoración de la primera ronda de las 3 advertencias sanitarias y sus pictogramas colocadas en los paquetes de cigarrillo desde el año 2006 a marzo de 2009 con el objetivo de conocer la opinión de los fumadores sobre los beneficios que sobre el consumo de tabaco tienen las mismas para ello se aplicó una encuesta a una muestra aleatoria de 993 fumadores de las Ciudades de Panamá y Colón. 
Para fines prácticos las advertencias y sus pictogramas fueron presentadas en la cara frontal de la encuesta con la intención de tener la seguridad de que los encuestados no presentaban confusiones con otras imágenes de control de tabaco circulantes en el país. Los temas de las advertencias fueron: Fumar produce cáncer de pulmón Fumar produce enfermedades cardiovasculares y Fumar durante el embarazo produce parto prematuro.
Los resultados reflejan que las imágenes permiten apreciar mejor el contenido de la advertencia sanitaria que los mensajes de texto. Cerca de 8 de cada 10 entrevistados han leído estos mensajes un 54% se abstuvo por lo menos una vez de fumar un cigarrillo en el último mes como una respuesta a la advertencias sanitarias. A uno de cada dos las advertencias le hacen pensar en los daños que causa fumar y al 40% las advertencias le hacen pensar en dejar de fumar el 87% reconoce y acepta que las advertencias que hoy forman parte de la campaña de No Fumar son en algo ciertas o muy ciertas.
