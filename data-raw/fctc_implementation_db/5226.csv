"112","Panama","Se cuenta con el estudio sobre Análisis de la demanda de tabaco en Panamá y el control del efecto asequibilidad con medidas fiscales y control del contrabando Implicaciones para Política Fiscal 2000-2011. realizado por el Lic. Herrera. en el año 2013 y financiado por el IDRC. que destaca entre otras cosas que: 
a dos años de aplicadas las medidas fiscales existen evidencias de los efectos en materia de fiscal. lo que deja en claro su efectividad en el aumento de la recaudación a partir del ISC y en una reducción de la demanda ante el incremento del precio de los productos derivados del tabaco. específicamente de los cigarrillos. 
el incremento de la renta nacional por habitante en períodos cortos. han podido haber neutralizado en parte el efecto del incremento del ISC y hacer más asequible el consumo de cigarrillos y otros derivados del tabaco a corto plazo.
el modelo que presentó el mejor ajuste fue el convencional. con una elasticidad precio de -0.82. dejando un umbral de incremento del ISC en 12%. a dos años del último incremento del 100%. se partió de un precio promedio por cajetilla de 20 cigarrillos de B/. 3.63 que considera las 3 marcas más vendidas en el país. frente al precio promedio de finales de 2009. de B/. 1.83. 
la Curva de Laffer. solo plantea un escenario probable sobre la base del descenso de las importaciones a lo largo del período de estudio. El signo negativo de la elasticidad ingreso de la demanda en todos los modelos ha sido objeto de amplio debate. 
las series históricas evidencian una relación inversa entre el ingreso y consumo. desde principios del período de estudio. lo cual deja abierta la posibilidad de sesgo derivado de sub declaraciones aduaneras y de impuestos o el contrabando. 
Los resultados reflejan que las medidas impositivas se han estrechado. momentáneamente ante el último incremento del ISC. Un tema pendiente de mayor debate es que las elasticidades no son estáticas en el tiempo. lo cual deja siempre abierta la posibilidad de cambios estructurales en el consumo que pueden afectar la interpretación de la Curva de Laffer. lo cual deja en claro su limitación respecto de consideraciones impositivas a largo plazo. 

El estudio se complementó con los análisis de las encuestas de marcas y de percepción de los efectos de las medidas de control en locales de esparcimiento y diversión y se contrastó con los resultados preliminares de la encuesta GATS. Panamá -2013. 
Mayores detalles pueden ser revisados en el informe del estudio en mención. el cual se adjunta","En el 2010 se elaboró el estudio sobre la demanda de productos de tabaco en el país y se analizó la elasticidad de la demanda y estimó el punto donde un incremento en el impuesto genera un incremento en los precios de los productos sin disminuir la recaudación fiscal por este rubro. Esta evidencia estuvo disponible unos meses después del incremento de los impuestos realizado a finales de 2009. Entre sus conclusiones están:
El consumo de cigarrillos ha sido modelado con un modelo de corrección de error y las variables típicas de precio e ingreso de una función de demanda han ajustado adecuadamente lo que se ha utilizado para calcular las elasticidades precio e ingreso. Asimismo se han verificado las hipótesis de adicción miope y adicción racional efectuando especificaciones de la función de demanda acorde a tal fin.
Al hacer una revisión general y descriptiva de los datos se pudieron identificar períodos críticos en la evolución del consumo y del precio los que aparecen relacionados con modificaciones impositivas en los impuestos a los cigarrillos.
Las elasticidades estimadas de corto y largo plazo respecto del precio son |-0.70| y |-1.04| y las elasticidades ingreso son 1.60 y 2.39 respectivamente de acuerdo a la estimación del modelo de corrección de errores. La demanda a largo plazo es unitariamente elástica al precio por lo que las medidas de control de tabaco a través de aumentos a los impuestos a los productos de tabaco son una medida efectiva para restringir el consumo de estos productos. Sin embargo la elasticidad ingreso de la demanda es muy elástica por lo que el aumento de la de la renta per cápita opera como un fuerte factor a favor de aumentar el consumo de estos productos. Este aumento en la asequibilidad de los cigarrillos pueden neutralizar las políticas de aumentos de precios de los cigarrillos vía aumentos de impuestos; en el caso de Panamá incluso pueden ser más fuertes dados los elevados valores de la elasticidad ingreso de la demanda de cigarrillos.
Las pruebas de hipótesis sobre la determinación de la exogeneidad del precio han dado como resultado que el precio es una variable exógena por lo que Panamá es un país tomador del precio internacional del cigarrillo. Esto se explica por no tener Panamá una industria tabacalera desde finales de la década pasada ser una economía abierta y con una posición estratégica en las rutas del comercio internacional.
Además de los resultados de la función de demanda estimada para Panamá es necesario tomar en cuenta otros factores que pueden interactuar con la renta y dejar neutralizados a largo plazo los resultados esperados de las medidas de control de consumo.
Al analizar los resultados de las encuestas de Mundial de Tabaco en Jóvenes (2002 y 2008) al igual que la encuesta de Propósitos Múltiples de 2006 deja en claro en el primer caso que las prevalencias de vida se han reducido de 32.2% a 17.1% al igual que la prevalencia actual (30 días) al bajar de 13.2 % a 4.3% en","Se esta desarrollando un estudio sobre oferta - demanda de productos de tabaco en el país con la finalidad de valorar la elasticidad de la demanda y estimar el punto donde un incremento en el impuesto genera un incremento en los precios de los productos sin disminuir la recaudación fiscal por este rubro para con esta evidencia generar estrategias que permitan continuar el proceso de incremento de impuestos a los productos del tabaco."
