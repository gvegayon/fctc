Different interpretations on the language of the law have allowed different levels of implementation nationwide ranging from a total ban mainly in companies health-care units and government facilities to situations where smoking and non smoking areas share the same room. This last situation has been very usual mainly in bars restaurants and other entertainment and hospitality sectors. 
Another important problem with the current Federal law is related to the lack of inspection and penalties application by sanitary authorities in municipal level what by its turn is a result from the low understanding of second hand smoke as a threat to health by policy makers in local level. 
Since 2008 two Bills of law (BL 315/08 and BL 316/08) related to the Federal law are under appreciation in Senate. But they are competitive: the BL 315/08 proposes a total ban and the BL 316/08 proposes to keep smoking designated areas worsening the current federal legislation as it takes out the rule establishing that the smoking designated areas must be exclusively to smoke. There is a strong lobby from tobacco industry in National Congress to dismiss BL 315 and approve BL 316. 
By the other hand from 2008 on states and municipalities started to approve their own legislation on this matter. Currently 21 states and the Federal District (FD) approved their own legislation. From this total 7 adopted a total ban (following the BL 315) and other 14 and the FD adopted a legislation following the BL 316 (keeping smoking in designated areas). In municipal level 23 municipalities approved legislation banning smoking designated areas and 09 approved laws keeping it. Those states that banned smoking designated areas are being challenged in Court by organizations affiliated to tobacco industry under the argument that state and municipal laws are unconstitucional if more restrictive than the federal law.
