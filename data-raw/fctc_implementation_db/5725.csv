"23","Bulgaria","Within the RDP are not supported activities related to the production of tobacco. In the texts of Program for the period 2007-2013 has been indicated that support for tobacco producers will be fully focused on diversifying their holdings. Support for tobacco producers is aimed at the diversification of the activities of farmers by non-agricultural activities or different types of agricultural activities aimed at diversification of tobacco production within the tools of RDP.
The producers that suspend activities related to the production of tobacco and start to deal with growing cows (in milk or meat direction) sheep and goats or with production of fruits and vegetables in 2014 can take advantage of the support that is provided by the following schemes for specific support:

En base al FCT se han hecho estudios sobre distintas alternativas: productos hortofrutícolas agricultura ecológica biocarburantes y se han llevado a cabo proyectos de: cultivo de plantas aromáticas tomate brócoli agroenergéticos etc.
Dichos estudios y experiencias concluyen que si bien la respuesta agronómica es satisfactoria en las zonas donde se localiza la alternativa al cultivo del tabaco es económicamente difícil pues pasa por muchas diferentes soluciones y no existe una gran y única alternativa.","Answer/report not provided"
