The NTS 2012-2018 was developed by the Intergovernmental Committee on Drugs. Standing Committee on Tobacco as a sub-strategy under the National Drug Strategy 2010-2015. and sets out a national framework to reduce tobacco related harm in Australia. with the goal “to improve the health of all Australians by reducing the prevalence of smoking and its associated health. social and economic costs. and the inequalities it causes”.
The objectives of the NTS 2012-2018 are to:
1. prevent uptake of smoking;
2. encourage and assist as many smokers as possible to quit as soon as possible. and prevent relapse;
3. reduce smoking among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. groups at higher risk from smoking. and other populations with a high prevalence of smoking;
4. eliminate harmful exposure to tobacco smoke among non-smokers;
5. reduce harm associated with continuing use of tobacco and nicotine products;
6. ensure that tobacco control in Australia is supported by focused research and evaluation; and
7. ensure that all of the above contribute to the continued denormalisation of smoking. 
The NTS 2012-2018 identifies nine priority areas for action. including; 
1. Protect public health policy. including tobacco control policies. from tobacco industry interference;
2. Strengthen mass media campaigns to : motivate smokers to quit and recent quitters to remain quit; discourage uptake of smoking; and reshape social norms about smoking; 
3. Continue to reduce the affordability of tobacco products; 
4. Bolster and build on existing programs and partnerships to reduce smoking rates among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; 
5. Strengthen efforts to reduce smoking among people in populations with a high prevalence of smoking;
6. Eliminate remaining advertising. promotion and sponsorship of tobacco products;
7. Consider further regulation of the contents. product disclosure and supply of tobacco products and alternative nicotine delivery systems;
8. Reduce exceptions to smoke-free workplaces. public places and other settings; and
9.	Provide greater access to a range of evidence-based cessation services and supports to help smokers to quit.
The NTS 2012-2018 also recognises the social and health inequalities associated with tobacco use. and emphasises the importance of working in partnership to reduce smoking rates among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. and other populations with a high prevalence of smoking.
Overall progress under the NTS 2012-2018 will be monitored using targets consistent with the performance benchmark agreed by the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) in the 2008 National Healthcare Agreement and its 2012 update. and the public health outcome identified in the COAG 2008 National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health and its 2012 update. These targets are set out in the NTS 2012-2018 (pages 2. 11 and 38) as follows:
By 2018:
1. Reduce the national adult daily smoking rate to 10 per cent of the population.
2. Halve the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adult daily smoking rate (from 47%) over the 2009 baseline","New coordination arrangements for tobacco control in Australia are being implemented under the National Drug Strategy 2010-15. A Standing Committee on Tobacco co-chaired by the Australian Government and the government of the State of South Australia has been established under the Intergovernmental Committee on Drugs (IGCD). The Standing Committee includes expert members from outside the government sector including an Indigenous expert member. The first priority of the Standing Committee is the development of a new National Tobacco Strategy (NTS) for 2012-18. The NTS fits within the National Drug Strategy and is auspiced through the IGCD. It is the framework for national tobacco control policy and programs. At the time of submission of this report the draft for consultation of the National Tobacco Strategy 2012-18 was under consideration by all jurisdictional health ministers.
The National Healthcare Agreement of the Council of Australian Governments (comprising all States and Territories and the Commonwealth Government) has set a target of reducing the adult daily smoking rate in Australia to ten per cent by 2018 and halving Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smoking rates within the same period. The National Preventative Health Strategy of the Preventative Health Taskforce and the Governments response to that Strategy also outline strategic directions and targets for these reductions.","."

This strategy will cover all kinds of addiction: non-substance as well substance related addictions including alcohol and tobacco. In thins context the national strategy will also cover national coordinating mechanism for tobacco control taking into the account the FCTC provisions. In preparation of this strategy the FMH initiated and completed already a study (“Delphi-Study”) in order to consult well-known experts and practitioners in the fields of science and addiction related matters. 
On provincial level there are already some addiction prevention strategies existing taking into account tobacco prevention measures/activities (monitored by the FMH). Carinthia f.ex. is currently developing a regional tobacco strategy.
On World No Tobacco Day 2006 the Austrian quitline (“Rauchertelefon”) an initiative of the Social Insurance Agencies the Austrian Provinces and the FMH was launched. It provides information and help on smoking and smoking cessation. Besides also on subnational level several programmes are initiated many of them by addiction prevention units on provincial or regional level. As from 1st May 2014 the Austrian quitline will be renaimed from “Rauchertelefon” (“smoking quitline”) into” Rauchfrei Telefon” (“smokefree quitline”) and will be furthermore offered free of charge.","As of 1/1/2009 major amendments to the Austrian tobacco act entered into force including smoking restrictions (with exemptions) also for hospitality venues. After a transitional period lasting until 30/6/2010 at least 50% of the places of all hospitality venues with the exemption of 1-room-premises with a surface of under 50m² (in certain cases up to 80m² if a division into 2 rooms is forbidden by legal provisions) must be smokefree. If hospitality venues provide more than 1 room for serving guests the main room is in any case covered by a smoking ban. Smoking and non-smoking areas cannot be in one room but only in detached rooms that can be closed with a door. Hospitality venues have to be marked as smoking/non-smoking or mixed premises at the entrance and also inside. Fines for violations of the smoking bans were introduced for the tenants of the premises (public rooms as well as hospitality venues) as well as smokers. As of 1/7/2010 within the Federal ministry of health an Ombudsstelle for the protection from tobacco smoke has been estblished where citizens can ask questions and address complaints about violations of smoking bans etc.","Answer/report not provided"

"28","Canada","Canada continues to make substantial progress in tobacco control. Smoking prevalence has decreased to an all-time low of 16%. down from 22% in 2001. The most significant reduction in smoking rates is among youth. aged 15-19 from 28% in 1999 to 11% in 2012.
The Federal Tobacco Control Strategy (FTCS) was introduced in 2001 as a 10-year. comprehensive. sustained and integrated Strategy to achieve significant reductions in disease and death due to tobacco use. The Government of Canada has renewed the policy authority of the FTCS for five years (2012-2017).

Since 2001. the role of the provincial and territorial governments in tobacco control has grown. All provinces and territories have major legislation and/or comprehensive tobacco strategies in place. and provincial/territorial investment in tobacco control has more than doubled. Health Canada focuses its anti-smoking efforts in core areas of federal responsibility to preserve the gains that have been realised and to continue downward trends in smoking prevalence. 

Key elements of the renewed FTCS include:

support to provincial and territorial cessation counselling services to support increased call volume and web counselling as a result of the display of the pan-Canadian quitline number and cessation web address on cigarette and little cigar packages;
support for a targeted number of on-reserve First Nations and Inuit communities to strengthen and implement tobacco control measures;
launching a marketing. awareness and outreach campaign focussed on cessation for young adult smokers;
continuing to verify compliance with the Tobacco Act. including labelling and minimum packaging requirements.;
contributing to international efforts to reduce tobacco use;
coordinating efforts with provinces. territories and other partners and stakeholders;
identifying and disseminating promising practices and lessons learned from previous funded projects to inform the tobacco control activities of partners; 
supporting a biennial survey that will continue to track tobacco use in Canada. as well as the use of other substances. by merging the Canadian Tobacco Use Monitoring Survey with the Canadian Alcohol and Drug Use Monitoring Survey; and.
supporting a core litigation. policy. and regulatory capacity.
The Public Health Agency of Canada will also provide funding for tobacco-related interventions that aim to reduce tobacco use as a chronic disease risk factor.","Canadas successful policy of enabling a strict regulatory environment that severely limits the tobacco industrys ability to use promotion to attract new smokers combined with programs that provide Canadians with information on the dangers of smoking has produced results. Between 2001 and 2010 smoking rates dropped from 22% to a lowest-ever 17%. The FTCS target of reducing the Canadian youth (aged 15-17) smoking rate to 9% was reached. This is the lowest smoking rate ever recorded for Canadian youth.
On September 22 2011 the Tobacco Products Labelling Regulations (Cigarettes and Little Cigars) came into force. These regulations introduce new and larger health warning messages including images targeting young people that cover 75 percent of the front and back of cigarette and little cigar packages to increase awareness of the health hazards associated with tobacco use. Manufacturers of tobacco products have a transition period of six months for implementation and must comply as of March 21 2012 while retailers have a transition period of nine months and must comply as of June 19 2012.The new labels also include a pan-Canadian toll-free quitline number and web that will link callers to provincial and territorial cessation services.
The Federal Tobacco Control Strategy was extended for one year until March 2012 to allow for the implementation of these recent initiatives and to explore new approaches for the future federal role in tobacco control. Health Canada launched an online stakeholder consultation on the future of tobacco control to provide a forum for public input. Health Canada is finalizing options for the future federal role in tobacco control.","Canada has made significant advancements post Group One reporting. New federal legislation The Cracking Down on Tobacco Marketing Aimed at Youth Act amends existing provisions in the Tobacco Act. The new provisions include banning flavours in cigarillos (little cigars) cigarettes and blunts (tobacco rolling papers) establishing a minimum package size of 20 for little cigars and blunt wraps and prohibiting tobacco advertising in publications.

In 2013 Finland participated actively in the negotiations of EU Tobacco Products Directive which will be formally adopted in May 2014.

The aim of this Act is to end the use of tobacco products containing compounds that are toxic to humans and create addiction. Finland is the first country to lay down the aim of putting an end to smoking in law. The Act provides a starting point for a more comprehensive tobacco control strategy. 
The Act restricts the marketing and supply of tobacco products especially in the everyday life of children. Not only shops but also private persons may not sell or supply tobacco products to persons under 18. Even selling one cigarette or fetching a packet of cigarettes from a shop to a minor person should be interpreted as a tobacco selling violation for which the person can be fined or sentenced to prison for a maximum of six months. It is also forbidden to offer tobacco without payment to minor persons but this is not punishable however. People under 18 are forbidden to import and possess tobacco products. A fine can be imposed on import of tobacco products but possession is not punishable under the law. Also sellers of tobacco products must be aged at least 18 years.
In addition there is a total ban on the sale of snuff in Finland as the ban on import and sale will be extended to also apply to private persons. Ordering snuff e.g. via the Internet is also forbidden. A maximum of 30 packets each containing 50 grams snuff may however be imported for ones own use. It is forbidden to import snuff as a gift.
The prohibitions against smoking were extended e.g. in facilities used by children and young people the joint facilities of apartment house companies events organized outdoors and hotel rooms.
