En el descenso en el número de tabaqueros. ha tenido que ver la reforma de la regulación europea del sector. en 2006. que ha supuesto desvincular. de la producción. las ayudas al tabaco. Es decir. actualmente las ayudas se cobran. independientemente de lo que cultives. por referencia histórica y no por kilogramo producido y entregado a la industria (exceptuando la ayuda a la calidad. con un montante muy reducido). 
Este esquema de ayudas. ha supuesto un desincentivo al cultivo de tabaco: desde 2005. la producción y superficie se han rebajado un 17.05% y un 20.58%. respectivamente. El número de cultivadores de tabaco han bajado en un 62.1% (la mayor reducción en el número de activos que en superficie y producción. se explica por un incremento en las mejoras tecnológicas del cultivo).

En la disminución del número de tabaqueros ha influido:
  - La entrada en vigor de la reforma del sector en 2006 que ha supuesto desvincular las ayudas al tabaco en un 60% entre 2006 y 2009 y en un 100% a partir de 2010. Es decir en la actualidad las ayudas (denominadas: pago único) se cobran independientemente de lo que cultives por referencia histórica y no por kilogramo producido y entregado a la industria. 
Este sistema ha provocado un reajuste del sector que se ha traducido en una reducción del 17% en producción y superficie cultivada y en una disminución del número de tabaqueros del 58% (la mayor reducción en el número de activos que en superficie y producción se explica por un incremento en las mejoras tecnológicas del cultivo).
  - En el reajuste del sector también ha pesado la coyuntura actual de disminución del consumo mundial de tabaco desde 2009 en confrontación con el aumento de la producción.

"150","The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia","Answer from the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and water economy:
Republic of Macedonia is ranked on the 30th place for the amount of tobacco produced in the world and on the 15th place in the realized value of export of tobacco in the world.Upon considering industrial crops tobacco prevails among them as a very significant labor-intensive crop in areas with difficult conditions for agricultural production. Out of the total planted area under industrial crops in 2012 73.77 % were planted with tobacco. Most tobacco is grown in Pelagonia and Southeast parts of Macedonia (Radovis and Strumica).The primary production of oriental type small leaf aromatic tobaccos have great economic and social importance for the Republic of Macedonia as a country which is traditional manufacturer of this type of tobacco. From the oriental types of tobacco the varieties grown in the republic of Macedonia are the following: Prilep Yaka Basmak and significantly small quantities of Dzebel. In some years semi-oriental type Otlja is produced. In the period before the year 2004 we had successful growing of broad-leaf tobacco types Virginia and Burley especially the tobacco type Virginia. Our state has abandoned the credentials in tobacco production except the controls established in the Law on of tobacco and tobacco products. For these reasons we believe that Macedonia will remain for the next 7 years almost an exclusive manufacturer of oriental types of tobacco. This conclusion arises out of the fact that there is a lack of state regulation on the quantity and type structure of the produced tobacco by tobacco harvest.
At this point the oriental tobacco is a major export product. Because of its high quality the Macedonian oriental tobacco is greatly valued in the international market and along with the tobacco products it represents an important export product of the country. Today over 99% of the total tobacco production is oriented towards the requirements of multinational companies which through their registered companies for purchase of raw tobacco are ensuring placement of fermented tobacco on foreign markets. At the present time almost all tobacco production is in the hands of individual producers - farmers.The tobacco production in the Republic of Macedonia for the period of the last 3 years (according to data from the State Statistical Office) is presented in Table 1.

In 2012 individual farmers achieved an average yield of tobacco of 1392 kg / ha compared with 2011 when the average yield of tobacco was lower - 348 kg / ha.In order to objectively presented the dynamics of production and purchase of tobacco the data will be analyzed by harvests (Table 2).

27993 tons of tobaccos are purchased from the crop 2012 or about 33 % compared to the crop 2011 when the purchase was 21024 tons. The size of the purchase mostly depends on the demand of the external market and the multinational companies in the country that are represented by 8 registered companies. However their demand is largely dependent on the impact of the international market (supply - demand) and the climate conditions in our country and in the surrounding countries.
The subsidy for crop 2012 as in the previous years (starting from crop 2009) is 60.00 MKD per kilogram of sold tobacco to tobacco purchase companies.

** Calculations made by MAFWE
The number of producers (number of contracts for growing of tobacco) in the analyzed period has a tendency to increase from 29646 in 2007 to 40 473 in 2010 and the average in the analyzed period is 34075. The former practice of making double and even triple contracts by one household with various tobacco companies especially in the period prior to 2006 has gradually been overcome. After 2007 the controls by the competent ministry and the agricultural inspection are very strong and the number of contracts decreases and represents more objective figures. Considering that the average number of members in households producing tobacco is 4.5 and that this average is higher than the average for the whole country (3.76 in 2012) then it can be concluded that 155000 persons are engaged in tobacco production or about 6-8% of the total population in the Republic of Macedonia. From the above quantitative analysis the conclusion is obvious that in the Republic of Macedonia large number of the population finds its social and economic security by engaging their own labor in tobacco production.
The achieved average production of raw tobacco per one tobacco producer (household) in the analyzed period was 600 kg and it has a trend of a slight increase in recent years. If we take into account the previously established fact that the number of members in a tobacco producer family (household ) ranges from 4 to 5 (median 4.5 ) the average production of raw tobacco per person is 133 kilograms which is relatively low compared to the production of broad-leaf tobacco in comparison with some countries that are reputable producers and account for several tons per member of the family.
The average area per household is not large and ranges between 0 44 to 0 59 ha or an average for the analyzed period - 0 54 ha. This situation of small estates is almost the same as in the republic of Bulgaria our Eastern neighbour which is also a large producer of oriental tobacco. In Bulgaria according to EU criteria the areas under one hectare broken to several land-plots are not considered as subject to subsidies. The problem is solved in a manner that the subsidies are still paid per kilogram of tobacco (not per unit of area as in the EU) from the state budget and not from the European funds.

**Realized production and average space per tobacco producer our calculations
If we take into consideration the average number of members in one household that is producing tobacco is 4 5 and that this average is higher than the average in the whole state (3 76 for the year 2012) in such a case we may conclude that 155000 are engaged in production of this crop or 6-8% of the total population in the republic of Macedonia. The conclusion is obvious that in the Republic of Macedonia larger part of the population can establish their social and economy security by engaging themselves in production of tobacco.","Answer/report not provided","Answer/report not provided"
