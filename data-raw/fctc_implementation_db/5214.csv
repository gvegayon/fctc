The FTCS is championed by the Controlled Substances and Tobacco Directorate (CSTD) of the Healthy Environments and Consumer and Safety Branch within Health Canada. The Regions and Programs Branch delivers the program component of the FTCS through a grants and contribution program and supports public education through the national and regional offices.
Contraband tobacco products are those sold without the collection of all applicable national and sub-national taxes. These illegal lower-prices cigarettes undermine tax and public health measures put in place to reduce tobacco use. 
The FTCS provides approximately $16 million per year to support the intelligence work of the CRA CBSA and RCMP to address contraband and to ensure compliance with Canadas tobacco tax laws. Health Canadas demand reduction activities such as prevention and cessation initiatives complement the contraband control activities of the these partners.
Canada places a strong emphasis on collaboration between the federal provincial territorial and municipal governments as well as non-governmental organizations tobacco control researchers academics and community organizations. Federal provincial and territorial investments in tobacco control now total more than $150 million each year.","The Government of Canadas Federal Tobacco Control Strategy (FTCS) is championed by the Controlled Substances and Tobacco Directorate (CSTD) of the Healthy Environments and Consumer and Safety Branch within Health Canada. 
CSTD supports a tobacco policy unit within the Office of Policy and Strategic Planning a Litigation Support Division an Office of Tobacco Research Surveillance and Evaluation and an Office of Tobacco Regulations and Compliance. Furthermore other elements within Health Canada have a role to play in tobacco control including the Regions and Programs Branch First Nations and Inuit Health and the Public Health Agency of Canada. Canadas Federal Tobacco Control Strategy is also supported by 6 regional offices which fund localized tobacco control initiatives and monitors regulatory compliance. 
A summative evaluation of the Federal Tobacco Control Strategy is required by Canadas Treasury Board Secretariat and this work is conducted by CSTDs Evaluation Unit in cooperation with Health Canadas Departmental Evaluation Directorate. The evaluation examines success cost effectiveness and relevance and covers all funded elements of the FTCS including other federal government partners. A mid-term summative evaluation was conducted in 2006 looking at the first five years of the Strategy. Evaluation updates are produced annually based on ongoing reviews of community regional and nationally contribution funded projects; and new estimates developed from econometric and cost effectiveness modelling. 
Overall the evaluation of the FTCS continues to indicate success in reducing smoking in Canada and finds that the investment is producing significant cost savings to the health care system and productivity gains in the Canadian economy. Specifically the evaluation notes that - Sharp declines in smoking in the early years of the FTCS can likely be attributed to the graphic warnings on packages increases in tobacco control spending increases in the strength of smoking bans and increases in the real price of cigarettes. There is some evidence however that the impact of price (taxation) and smoking bans are declining which corresponds to a slowing in the rate of decline of the national prevalence rate. 
During the fiscal period 2008-09 there were 152 staff positions dedicated to tobacco control with an annual expenditure for tobacco control activities of $34 million and an additional $16 million in grants and contribution funding."
