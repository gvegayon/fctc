The ban covers print media radio internet and sponsorship of events involving several Member States. Free distribution of tobacco is banned in such events. The directive does not distingusish between the domestic and the global Internet.
Tobacco advertising and sponsorship on television was prohibited in the EU in 1989 by the Television without Frontiers Directive (89/552/EEC). This Directive has been replaced by the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (2007/65/EC) adopted in December 2007 which extends the application of this ban to all forms of audiovisual commercial communications including product placement.
The Council Recommendation (2003/54/EC) on the Prevention of Smoking and on Initiatives to improve tobacco control covers other forms of tobacco promotion. It recommends EU Member States to prohibit the use of tobacco brand names on non-tobacco products or services; the use of promotional items and tobacco samples the use and communication of sales promotion such as a discount a free gift a premium or an opportunity to participate in a promotional contest or game; the use of billboards posters and other indoor or outdoor advertising techniques (such as advertising on tobacco vending machines); the use of advertising in cinemas and any other forms of advertising sponsorship or practices directly or indirectly addressed to promote tobacco products.
