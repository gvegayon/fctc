In lieu thereof the weighted average retail selling price (WAP) will be the calculation base (determined at the latest by 1 March of each year based on all releases data of the preceding year).

A Member State applying a transitional period and whose duty has reached a monetary level of EUR 77 per any 1000 cigarettes may impose a quantitative limit of at least 300 cigarettes which may be brought into its territory without further excise duty payment from another Member State applying a transitional period as long as the latter Member State has not yet reached an equal monetary level.
o	Escape clause
As from 1 January 2014 Member States which levy an excise duty of at least EUR 115 (current 101) per 1000 cigarettes need not comply with the 60% requirement.

"95","Mexico","Answer/report not provided","De acuerdo al Decreto del IEPS para el ejercicio 2010 el Impuesto Especial sobre Producción y Servicios se incrementó del 150% al 160% y se estableció por primera vez un impuesto nuevo bajo la figura de una cuota específica. En ese primer momento el Congreso aprobó que esa cuota específica sufriera incrementos graduales bajo el siguiente esquema: $ 0.80 pesos en 2010 $ 1.20 pesos en 2011 $ 1.60 en 2012 y $ 2.00 en 2013. 
 Así mismo el Impuesto al Valor Agregado se incrementó del 15 al 16% a partir del 1º de enero del 2010 permaneciendo en ese nivel hasta la fecha. 
Si bien el monto del gravamen por virtud de la cuota específica fue muy modesto y además se estableció bajo un esquema de gradualidad contraviniendo las mejores prácticas la Ley del IEPS 2010 tuvo la virtud de que permitió por primera vez fijar un gravamen específico por cigarrillo enajenado en México que constituyó la base del incremento que el Congreso aprobó para el 2011 año en el que se incrementó esta cuota específica a $0.35 por cigarrillo enajenado lo que representó un incremento por virtud del impuesto del 26 % respecto al precio de venta del 2010 con lo que la carga fiscal de los productos de tabaco en nuestro país se ubicó a partir del 2011 en 69.2 %. 
Es de destacar que la Ley del IEPS 2011 también derogó el Artículo Cuarto Transitorio del Decreto de la Ley del IEPS 2010 que era precisamente el que mandataba la gradualidad en el aumento anual de la cuota específica a partir del 2010 y hasta 2013. 

La Ley del IEPS 2011 no consideró la indexación de la cuota específica a la inflación. Para evitar que el gravamen pierda su efecto disuasorio y se dé un repunte en la demanda de los productos del tabaco la Oficina Nacional para el Control del Tabaco del Centro Nacional para la Prevención y el Control de las Adicciones promovió ante el poder legislativo que en la iniciativa de la Ley del IEPS 2012 se considerara indexar este gravamen a los índices nacionales de inflación así mismo se propuso al legislativo que considerara un incremento adicional de $0.25 pesos por cigarrillo enajenado para un total de cinco pesos adicionales por cajetilla. 
En el transcurso del 2011 el cabildeo de la industria tabacalera para frenar cualquier incremento adicional a los impuestos de los productos del tabaco fue agresivo y resultó ser efectivo. Emplearon fundamentalmente los dos argumentos que les han dado resultado a nivel global: a) el incremento al contrabando como efecto directo del incremento a los impuestos y b) la caída de la recaudación fiscal como efecto del incremento en el contrabando. Así mismo pusieron en marcha una estrategia de comunicación social para posicionar estos argumentos en la opinión pública señalando de forma reiterada que el incremento del contrabando como consecuencia del incremento a la carga impositiva había sido escandaloso y que lejos de crecer la recaudación fiscal como se había estimado la misma se había reducido drásticamente","En 2006 a los cigarros se gravaron con una tasa de 110% fijándose nuevos incrementos escalonados así para 2007 fue de 140% sobre precio de venta al detallista aumentando a 150% en 2008 y a 160% en 2009. 
 Es de destacar que no obstante haber incrementado paulatinamente las tasas para los cigarros y los tabacos labrados en el ejercicio fiscal de 2009 aun no se alcanzan los niveles del 180% de IEPS establecido para los años 1986 1987 y 1988.
De acuerdo al Decreto del IEPS para el ejercicio 2010 este impuesto se establece en 160% y se pagará una cuota adicional bajo en siguiente esquema: $ 0.80 pesos en 2010 $ 1.20 pesos en 2011 $ 1.60 en 2012 y $ 2.00 en 2013. 
En el año 2005 el impuesto a los cigarrillos por concepto del Impuesto Especial sobre Producción y Servicios (IEPS) se fijó en 110 por ciento equivalente a 45 5 por ciento del precio final a los consumidores. Si se añade el valor por concepto del (IVA) - aplicados en casi todos los bienes y servicios en México la presión fiscal para los cigarrillos en ese año fue equivalente a 59 por ciento del precio final a los consumidores. Como se ha señalado la tasa actual del IEPS es de 160 por ciento los impuestos en México siguen siendo bajos en comparación con lospaíses de altos ingresos donde las tasas de impuestos equivalen al 75 por ciento del precio a los consumidores."

"117","Poland","The Polish fiscal policy in the field of excise duties on tobacco products takes into account the provisions of Article 6 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and the guidelines of the Act of 9 November 1995 on protection of health against the consequences of use of tobacco and tobacco products (OJ of 2010 No. 81 item 529 consolidated text). The excise duty on tobacco products and its annual increases are essential to reduce the popularity of tobacco use among adults and young people in Poland. The structure of excise duties is also an important factor in terms of limiting and even stopping smoking. Since 2009 in Poland is functioning the specific and ad valorem excise duty system on cigarettes and smoking tobacco. The increases of excise duty on these products are made by increasing the specific excise duty rate and by leaving the ad valorem excise duty rate at a fixed level. This policy is in line with the recommendations of the European Commission and the WHO. The excise duty increases and consequently the retail prices increases on tobacco products - introduced in 2012 and 2013 - are higher than the inflation rate. The increasing retail prices are a major economic barrier for smokers especially for young people providing an incentive to reduce or even give up smoking. The consequence of the increases is an annual ever higher decline in sales (in consumption) which is undoubtedly a positive development for the achievement of health objectives. The new regulation i.e. the excise duty on raw tobacco (tobacco leaves) introduced in 2013 has as a major goal to counter the illegal production and sales of tobacco products.","Excise duty raised from 47.98 in 2008 to 76.67 in 2011 [EUR/1000 pieces].","Answer/report not provided"

"133","Serbia","In 2012 the Excise Law was changed as to regulate the excise policy until 2016 with the aim of harmonization with the excise policy of European Union. According to the Law the amount of the specific excise has been increased every six months. The ad valorem component has been reduced irrelevant of the time period. In this way the conditions were established to increase incomes from the excise on cigarettes since the budget'' income is in a substantial way independent from the producers'' and importers'' price policy taking into account that the Government does not directly regulate the price of cigarettes but through the tax policy measures influences on steady increase of the tobacco product prices. At the same time the market is protected from the bad quality cigarettes and in this way the demand for cigarettes is reduced.
At the same time the weighted average retail selling price of cigarettes has been introduced (since 2012) instead of “the most popular price category of tobacco products” and as a consequence there is an increase of the minimal excise on cigarettes and other tobacco products.
Moreover since 2012 the specific earmarking (so called “budget''s dinar”) on all tobacco products according to the Tobacco Law was abolished and integrated into the specific excise on cigarettes (the last value of the this specific earmarking in 2012 was 1.66 RSD per package of cigarettes).
It has also been made mandatory to make inventory of all stock of cigarettes when the value of specific excise and minimal excise changes and to the quantity of cigarettes above allowed number calculate and pay excise tax.
There are also other measures that have influence on tobacco consumption such as bans and restrictions regulated by the Tobacco law (banning sales of cigarettes to minors; banning the sale of tobacco products which are directly accessible; banning the sale through vending machines; production and sale of sweets snacks or toys in the form of tobacco products; banning sale of packages less than 20 cigarettes; mandatory health warning on all tobacco products etc.).","As a way of further harmonisation of its excise policy with the system of cigarettes taxation in the EU the Republic of Serbia is increasing total excise burden on cigarettes because according to the general rule from the Council Directives 92/79/??C 99/81/??C and 02/10?C the total excise burden (specific excise + proportional excise) must not be below 57% of the retail price of one package of cigarettes in the category of cigarettes with the most popular price and the total excise must not be below 64€ per 1000 cigarettes in the category of cigarettes with the most popular price.
By the applicable excise policy in terms of increase of specific excise Serbia has further approached the mentioned EU standards. In this manner higher income from cigarretes excise is acquired bearing in mind that the budget income to a large extent does not depend on price policy of cigarettes producers and importers. Consequently the market is also protected from cheaper cigarettes of low quality. This has influence on decrease of cigarettes consumption and helps implementing the Framevork Convention on Tobacco Control
There are also other measures influencing reduction of tobacco products consumption such as certain prohibitions and restrictions sanctioned by the Law on tobacco (for example: prohibition of selling tobacco products to underaged persons prohibition of retail self-service selling of tobacco products prohibition of selling tobacco products on vending machines prohibition of production and selling of sweets snacks and toys in form of tobacco poducts; prohibition of production import and selling of cigarette packages with less than 20 pieces of cigarettes; obligation of marking tobacco products with health warnings etc.).
Restrictions concerning the sales to international travellers of tax-and duty-free tobacco products are regulated by as follows: Article 208 of Customs Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia No.18/10) and Article 562 of Regulation on customs-approved treatment to goods (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia No.93/10) where is only allowed sales to travellers who are leaving the customs territory of the Republic of Serbia.
Restrictions concerning the imports to international travellers of tax-and duty-free tobacco products are regulated by as follows: Article 5 of Law on Foreign Trade (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia No.36/09) Article 216 of Customs Law (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia No.18/10) and Article 3 of Regulation on the type quantity and value of goods relieved from import duties time limits conditions and procedure for claiming relief from import duties (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia No.48/10) where is allowed imports of tobacco products to travellers for personal use only (personal luggage).","As a way of further harmonisation of its excise policy with the system of cigarettes taxation in the EU the Republic of Serbia is increasing total excise burden on cigarettes because according to the general rule from the Council Directives 92/79/??C 99/81/??C and 02/10?C the total excise burden (specific excise + proportional excise) must not be below 57% of the retail price of one package of cigarettes in the category of cigarettes with the most popular price and the total excise must not be below 64€ per 1000 cigarettes in the category of cigarettes with the most popular price.
