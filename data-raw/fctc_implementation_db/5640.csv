Consequently the provision in force strictly prohibits tobacco sponsoring and the depiction of sponsorship identifiers for example on television and radio.

This prohibition would apply to both cross-border sponsorship and to a sponsorship in our own territory. According to the Government Bill sponsorship would mean any form of public or private contribution to any event activity or individual with the aim or direct or indirect effect of promoting a tobacco product.

"67","Iran (Islamic Republic of)","The Act (Articles 3 10 and 15) and the Bylaw (Articles 2 to 6 and 10) comprehensively ban all tobacco advertising promotion and sponsorship including both direct and indirect tobacco advertising promotion and sponsorship. The provisions of the Bylaw (Articles 2–6) specify the banning of various forms of indirect advertisements including the use of trade names and trademarks sales in a manner that promotes publicity grants of any aid 23 

assistance and support financial or other forms of incentives and promotional items. Article 10 of the Bylaw has prohibited sales of tobacco through the Internet and automatic vending machines which also have the effect of banning indirect advertisements. 
Article 10 of the Act imposes fines for violations of the law. In addition to that punishment the courts are obliged to order the confiscation of the products that are the objects of the advertisements. The Act further requests the Cabinet to revise the minimum and maximum levels of fines every three years on the basis of the official inflation rate. 
The HQ coordinates with the Ministry of Industry Mine and Trade the I. R. Iran Broadcasting (I.R.I.B) and the Department of Law Enforcement (Police) etc. in implementing this obligation. The I.R.I.B plays a key role and has established the Health Council to supervise the implementation of the comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising in all types of media generated from I.R. Iran''s territory. The I.R.I.B has also successfully banned the indirect advertising of tobacco via electronic media such as radio movies and television shows. The I.R.I.B has operated a routine monitoring mechanism to cut depictions of tobacco use the media under its authority. 
It was reported in the joint needs assessment meetings that compliance with the comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising promotion and sponsorship has been very satisfactory.","Generally all Parties to the Convention on this matter should take the necessary measures for the comprehensive ban on advertising promotion and sponsorship of tobacco. 
In the Islamic Republic of Iran the Comprehensive National tobacco control law based on Article 3 seriously banned any support promotion direct and indirect encouragement or provocation of people to smoke tobacco products. Article 10 of this law considered penalties for any violation against comprehensive ban of advertising promotion and sponsorship. According to Article 1 item 3 of the executive Bylaw of the National tobacco control law any activity or act direct or indirect for promotion motivating and encouraging people to purchase and consume tobacco products is defined as tobacco advertizing. In Article 15 of the Act Registering any trademarks or special names used for tobacco products shall not be used for non tobacco products or vice-versa. Considering the importance of having a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising this issue recall in Articles 2 3 4 5 6 and 10 of the executive Bylaw of the National tobacco control law that explicitly bans the use of brand names of tobacco companies on other commodities promotion of tobacco products by authorized agents the giving of any help donations and support both financial and non financial by tobacco manufacturers importers and exporters and purchase and sale of any goods for promotion of tobacco products and the sale of tobacco products through the internet and automatic vending machines. 
It is worth noting that this matter is one of the most challenging issues in the full implementation of the Convention and its members often are faced with many obstacles in enforcing this article such as some bilateral and multilateral agreements with multinational tobacco companies they had prior to joining the Convention.
Comprehensive ban on advertising promotion and sponsorship of tobacco in Iran was back after the Islamic Revolution in 1979. I.R.Iran is among the pioneers and few Parties to the Convention which has been successful in fully implementing Article 13 of WHO FCTC. 
Among the reasons for its success in fully implementing the ban on advertising tobacco products can be noted in government monopoly of tobacco. 
On the other hand adherence to the principles of Islam is one of the important factors of this success. According to the recommendations mentioned in Islamic texts and religious teachings any action which may endanger human health is prohibited.
