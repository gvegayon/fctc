The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (ACBPS) have an active ongoing role in monitoring and enforcement activity in relation to illicit tobacco production or importation. 
Current excise law provides a strong regulatory regime for licensing the manufacture and storage of tobacco products. controlling the movement of product on which excise has not been paid. and attendant sanctions and penalties for contravention of the regulatory provisions. Primary legislation is the Excise Act 1901 and the Excise Tariff Act 1921. 
The Criminal Code Act 1995 contains relevant offences including in relation to bribery of officials. dealing with proceeds of crime. obtaining financial advantage by deception and participating in a criminal group. 
The Crimes Act 1914 provides for search and seizure by the Australian Federal Police. The Customs Act 1901 provides for seizure and disposal by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 provides a comprehensive scheme for tracing. investigating. restraining and confiscating proceeds generated from Commonwealth indictable offences. foreign indictable offences and certain offences against state and territory law.
Recent steps taken by the Australian Government. as part of its ongoing work to reduce illicit trade in tobacco. include increased penalties for tobacco smuggling. On 6 November 2012. the Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Act 2012 received Royal Assent. The Act created new offences for smuggling tobacco or tobacco products and conveying or possessing smuggled tobacco products. and allows a penalty of up to ten years imprisonment to be imposed. in addition to the existing monetary penalty of up to five times the amount of duty evaded. These changes are intended to more accurately reflect the risks posed to the Australian community and the seriousness of the offences. and to provide a strong deterrent to criminals.
In relation to the Protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products (ITP). Australia was actively involved in the negotiation of the text of the ITP. participating in all the drafting group meetings and the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body. Australia has commenced work on the domestic processes that precede a decision by the Australian Government on whether to accede to the ITP.","The packaging of cigarettes for sale in Australia is subject to a number of legislative and regulatory requirements. These include a requirement for display of a trade description containing in prominent and legible characters the name of the country in which the goods were made or produced (Commerce (Imports) Regulations 1940) and a requirement that the name and business address of the manufacturer be displayed (National Trade Measurement Regulations 2009).

The excise stamp provides a reliable indicator of the legal and duty-paid status of tobacco products and. as a result. provides an additional enforcement tool for federal and provincial authorities.
The Federal Tobacco Control Strategy was renewed for 5 years. with continued funding and activities related to monitoring the contraband market to inform tax policy. In March 2013. the Government of Canada announced: the establishment of an RCMP Anti-Contraband Tobacco Force of 50 officers; the Trafficking in Contraband Tobacco Act  to establish mandatory minimum penalties for repeat offenders; and. funding of $3 million over two years for ten additional police officers in First Nations police services to focus on contraband tobacco.","Canada implemented an enhanced federal tobacco stamping regime in September 2010.
