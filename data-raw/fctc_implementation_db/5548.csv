However no requirement exists in the legislation for the analysis of the content of tobacco products. 
question 3.2.3.2: 
Testing and measuring emissions: The 2007 Tobacco Act stipulates that determination of emissions of smoked tobacco products (tar nicotine and carbon-monoxide levels of cigarettes) should be done by accredited laboratories. With respect to testing/measuring the Republic of Moldova does not have the necessary infrastructure and capacity in place to perform such testing. 
Only one laboratory for testing the quality of tobacco products exists in the country at the Chisinau Tobacco Factory. This laboratory is accredited by the National Accreditation Authority. The Ministry of Agriculture would support the establishment of an independent and objective laboratory in an institution controlled by the Ministry of Health. 
question 3.2.3.4: 
Regulating emissions: Article 10 of the 2007 Tobacco Act sets maximum levels for tar nicotine and carbon-monoxide in tobacco products.
