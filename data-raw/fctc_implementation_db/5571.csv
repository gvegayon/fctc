Tobacco Act concerning restaurants has reduced the exposure to tobacco smoke in the hospitality industry. However only after the total ban since June 2009 a significant reduction of exposure to tobacco smoke was detected among workers and clients in Finnish restaurants. The latest Tobacco Act concerning restaurants still allows the restaurant owners to build a tobacco cabin for smokers. However due to strict regulations and according to the preliminary findings from the FIOH smoke seems not to spread from smoking cabins to other areas of restaurants.

Estudio Global del Monitoreo de Aire
En el Mayo de 2008 Panamá participó del Estudio Global del Monitoreo de Aire: Comparación de los niveles de contaminación del aire en los espacios interiores de trabajo en varios países dicho estudio parte del hecho de que el humo de tabaco de segunda mano es una mezcla del humo producido por la quema de un cigarrillo pipa o puro y el humo que se exhala de los pulmones de los fumadores. En él hay más de 4 800 químicos que incluyen 69 carcinógenos y otras sustancias químicas que son irritantes tóxicos y mutágenos1. En 1986 se concluye que el humo de tabaco de segunda mano es causa de enfermedad en no fumadores saludables2. Estudios posteriores han clasificado el humo de tabaco de segunda mano como un carcinógeno humano.
La meta de este estudio es desarrollar una base de datos global que aporte información sobre la exposición de humo de tabaco de segunda mano basada en la evidencia obtenida a partir de mediciones del nivel de contaminación de aire. Se ha realizado en por lo menos 20 países alrededor del mundo. En América Central sólo se ha efectuado en Panamá. Se plantea la hipótesis que el aire en lugares cerrados podría ser menos contaminante en aquellos sitios donde está prohibido fumar es decir donde fumar no ocurre que en aquellos lugares donde fumar está permitido.
A final del mes de Abril del 2008 Panamá implementó la prohibición de fumar a nivel nacional. Esto hace ilegal fumar en Las oficinas públicas y privadas nacionales provinciales comarcales y locales; en los medios de transporte público en general y en las terminales de transporte terrestre marítimo y aéreo; en los lugares cerrados de acceso público donde haya concurrencia de personas entre las que se incluyen restaurantes y bares; en los ambientes públicos y privados abiertos y cerrados destinados a actividades deportivas; en las áreas comunes de los edificios públicos y privados de uso comercial y doméstico; en los ambientes laborales cerrados y en las instituciones educativas y de salud públicas y privadas. 
Los datos presentados son de Panamá y Argentina para lo que se aplicó el protocolo del Roswell Park Cancer Institute de Buffalo Nueva York. Se analizó la calidad del aire en restaurantes bares terminales de transporte incluyendo aeropuertos estaciones de trenes y de autobuses y otros sitios de interés utilizando el TSI SidePak AM 510 que permite tomar muestras y almacenar niveles de partículas suspendidas respirable (RSP) en el aire y se midió en el tiempo-real la concentración de las partícula con un"
