The new Directive prohibits the sale of cigarettes and RYO with characterising flavours. A characterising flavour is defined as clearly noticeable smell or taste other than tobacco. 
Flavourings are also not allowed in any of the tobacco product components such as filters papers packages or capsules. Filters papers and capsules shall not contain tobacco or nicotine.
The following additives are prohibited and products containing them shall not be placed on the market: 
(a)	vitamins or other additives that create the impression that a tobacco product has a health benefit or presents reduced health risks 
(b)	caffeine or taurine or other additives and stimulant compounds that are associated with energy and vitality 
(c)	additives having colouring properties for emissions 
(d)	for tobacco products for smoking additives that facilitate inhalation or nicotine uptake and 
(e)	additives that have CMR (= cancerogenic mutagenic or reprotoxic) properties in unburnt form 
Moreover tobacco products containing additives in quantities that increase the toxic or addictive effect or the CMR properties of a tobacco product at the stage of consumption to a significant or measureable degree shall not be placed on the market.
The full set of rules applies to cigarettes and Roll-Your-Own tobacco other tobacco products such as pipe tobacco or cigars can be brought under the stricter rules if consumption patterns change substantially.
