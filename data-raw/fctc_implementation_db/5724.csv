In addition to the grant project the Act also calls upon the Government to make necessary guidelines to promote for comprehensive discouragement in producing and using tobacco products and for discouragement to set up industries of tobacco products. The exact figures for the Government spending on this project were not provided during the mission but the Asian Bank for Development (ABD) also provided around US$ 40 million for the diversification project over the five years of the project. The crop diversification project for tobacco growers is implemented within the frame of a broader agricultural development project aimed at crop zoning and better utilization of land. The project will end in 2010 and it is still to be decided upon its possible continuation. 
Still very few growers decided to diversify; the challenge with this project rests in the fact that tobacco growing provides growers with a secure and guaranteed revenue (e.g. negotiations for minimum prices are led by the Ministry of Agriculture but the tobacco industry is one of the invited stakeholders). Crop diversification can only be successful if the other crop suggested instead of tobacco attracts the same level of income to growers and the Government ensures adequate level of subsidy for it. A detailed evaluation of the projects achievements impact and cost-effectiveness is necessary to take a decision with respect to its continuation.
The priorities of the agricultural ministry in relation to tobacco growing include the following: 
o	Leading discussions on the continuation of the diversification project;
o	Registration and licensing of all tobacco growers producers and other actors of the tobacco sector (this may help in tracing down production of bidis and unbranded low priced cigarettes in remote areas of the country).
o	Tackling the issue of subsidies if any related to agricultural inputs for tobacco growers.
WHO Bangladesh plans to organize a workshop for assistant agricultural officers on tobacco to sensitize them on issues related to tobacco control and to invite them advocating for crop diversification among the growers."

The Tobacco Transition Program (TTP) was announced on August 1 2008 and was implemented in mid-February 2009. Producers had until March 30 2009 to apply to the TTP. The objectives of the program were to 1) remove the quota system 2) facilitate the transition of tobacco quota holders and 3) improve the viability of remaining and future tobacco producers who now operate in a free-market environment. The federal Tobacco Transition Program provided about $284 million in 2009 to tobacco producers to help them exit the sector. The majority of Ontario tobacco producers agreed to transition out of tobacco production under this program. The program has seen the number of tobacco producers decline: before the tobacco program there were 446 tobacco producers and in 2011 there were approximately 214 licensed producers.

Ministry of Health has also written to Ministry of Commerce to consider schemes aimed at a time bound and targeted reduction in FCV tobacco crop in the coming years so as to meet our obligations under WHO FCTC as well as to reduce the health threat to our people from tobacco use. It has been suggested that for this purpose the tobacco farmers who are willing to shift over to other alternatives could be provided with support both monetary and technical for some period so that they do not suffer losses.

México solo produce el 0.17% de la producción mundial de hoja de tabaco sin embargo en apoyo a los cultivadores nacionales cuenta con el Programa de Uso Sustentable de Recursos Naturales para la Producción Primaria; en el cual se considera el componente de Reconversión Productiva mismo que opera a nivel nacional el cual apoya a los productores que deseen producir cultivos distintos a los que tradicionalmente hayan estado produciendo así como aquellos cultivos que les deje mayor rentabilidad.
México cuenta con solo tres entidades federativas productoras de hoja de tabaco: Nayarit Veracruz y Chiapas. El Estado de Nayarit produce casi el 80 % del tabaco nacional y junto con Veracruz producen en total el 93.7% de la producción nacional. De acuerdo con los estudios de potencial productivo del INIFAP y a la relación beneficio- costo las opciones para la reconversión del tabaco en Nayarit son: hortalizas (tomate chile verde pepino y otras hortalizas) frutales perenes (papaya cítricos mango plátano principalmente) y granos (sorgo arroz maíz frijol).Por ello en Nayarit se ha centrado la estrategia de reconversión del cultivo de tabaco en hortalizas granos y frutales perenes con alto potencial productivo con buena rentabilidad y demanda tanto en los mercados regionales nacional y de exportación que permiten a los productores obtener ingresos similares o superiores a los obtenidos con el tabaco.
En Veracruz se cultivan las variedades: Negro San Andrés Sumatra y Habano 2 000 las cuales se destinan para la producción de puros. La mayoría de la producción se destina a la exportación hacia Estados Unidos Canadá Alemania y España.
El presupuesto federal otorgado al Programa de Reconversión de Cultivos ascendió en 2010 a 30 millones de pesos y para el 2011 se incrementó a 400 millones de pesos. El resultado ha sido que la superficie cosechada de tabaco se redujo de 22 mil a más de 3.8 mil ha en los últimos doce años. En el mismo periodo la producción se redujo de 45 mil a 8.8 miles de ton. Lo que significa una reducción de 80.4% en la producción. El rendimiento pasó de 1.9 ton/hectáreas en el año 2000 a 1.59 ton/hectáreas en 2011. En 2011 se produjeron 8.8 miles de ton de tabaco principalmente en Nayarit (86%) Veracruz (10.24%) y Chiapas (2.9%) el 90% de la producción se obtiene en el ciclo O-I (principalmente en Nayarit) el 69% del total de la superficie se siembra en áreas de riego (2 930.2 ha en Nayarit y 191.3 ha en Chiapas) la superficie de temporal se ubica en Veracruz (1 111 ha) y Nayarit (291.42 ha). 
Nayarit es el primer estado productor de tabaco con una producción en el 2011 de 7.4 miles de ton (86% del total nacional) las principales zonas productoras son: costa","De acuerdo con las atribuciones de la SAGARPA de fomentar el desarrollo rural se cuenta con los programas y sus diversos componentes mismos que se establecen en las Reglas de Operación los cuales son los intrumentos para fomentar este desarrollo.
En ese sentido existe el Programa de Uso Sustentable de Recursos Naturales para la Producción Primaria; en el cual se considera el componente de Reconversión Productiva mismo que opera a nivel Nacional el cual apoya a los productores que deseen producir cultivos distintos a los que tradicionalmente hayan estado produciendo así como aquellos cultivos que les deje mayor rentabilidad.
Como ejemplo a lo señalado en el caso específico del Estado de Nayarit como principal productor de tabaco de acuerdo a estudios de potencial productivo realizados por el INIFAP y a la relación beneficio-costo se planteó la estrategia de reconversión del cultivo de tabaco a hortalizas (tomate chile verde pepino etc.) frutales perennes (papaya cítricos mango y plátano) y granos (sorgo arroz frijol y maíz) principalmente con alto potencial productivo con buena rentabilidad y demanda tanto en los mercados regionales nacional y de exportación que permiten a los productores obtener ingresos similares o superiores a los obtenidos con el tabaco.
La estrategia de reconversión es coordinada con los gobiernos de los estados las instituciones de investigación y los productores con el fin de encontrar las mejores alternativas que sean integrales que ofrezcan cultivos más rentables y que permitan mejorar sus ingresos así como elevar el nivel de vida de sus familias.
Se busca la aceptación de los productores al cambio de cultivo y se asegure su permanencia en la nueva actividad.
Es importante señalar que este esfuerzo por la reconversión del cultivo de tabaco se dá en un entorno positivo de precios internacionales altos de los granos lo que facilita el cambio de cultivo en las zonas tabacaleras que cuentan con un buen potencial productivo."

The production of tobacco itself has not been additionally subsidized.","In 2009 agrarian policy for tobacco switched from the price support (tobacco premium) to direct payments (payments per hectare). Regulation on terms and conditions of use of the funds for reimbursement of materials for farming and vegetable production from 2009 and 2010 (Official Gazette of RS No. 12/09 17/09 36/09 7 / 10 23/10 43/10 59/10 and 67/10) regulates the subsidies for tobacco production. According to this regulation subsidies for tobacco are 20.000 RSD per hectare which represents significant decrease in comparison with previous years when the average tobacco premium per registered farm amounted to 146.000 RSD. Only those farmers who reported tobacco in the crop structure in 2009 were eligible to receive subsidies which implies that new tobacco growers were not eligible for subsidies.
Moreover in 2009 was published the Decree on the program measures for refinancing of long-term liabilities arising from investments in tobacco production in 2009 (Official Gazette of RS No. 23/09). The aim is to help farmers to switch to alternative production and settle previously undertaken commitments to the tobacco industry. Farmers whose tobacco production in 2009 was registered to be 50% less than in 2008 were eligible for this funding. This measure was implemented in the way that funds were used for long-term lending for private individuals engaged in the production of tobacco and for settling financial commitments for the purchase of dryers and other equipment and machinery for manufacturing of tobacco. Ministry of Agriculture provides for this purpose 100 % of funds. Repayment period is four years with one year grace period and interest rates are not charged.","In 2009 agrarian policy for tobacco switched from the price support (tobacco premium) to direct payments (payments per hectare).

En 2010 las ayudas de la UE al sector como se ha explicado en el punto 2.7.2. se desvincularon o desacoplaron completamente de la producción y se redujeron un 50%. El 50% reducido se ha destinado a medidas de desarrollo rural (segundo pilar de la política agraria comunitaria PAC) según se establece por reglamento comunitario. Las actuaciones de desarrollo rural se financian con presupuesto comunitario y nacional (cofinanciación).
Dentro de dichas medidas se han adoptado a partir de 2010 algunas destinadas a promover alternativas al cultivo del tabaco y son:
  - Incremento de la dotación que ya existía de la medida de diversificación hacia actividades no agrícolas en la programación de desarrollo rural de la comunidad autónoma de Extremadura (principal región productora que concentra el 93% del cultivo de tabaco). 
  - Medida aprobada en 2009 en el Chequeo Médico de la PAC de explotaciones en proceso de reestructuración con motivo de la reforma de una OCM destinada a facilitar la reestructuración de explotaciones con dificultades por tener una reducción de pagos directos en 2010 respecto a 2009 de más del 25% como es el caso del cultivo del tabaco. Consiste en una ayuda por explotación (en fase de reestructuración) decreciente: 4 500 € en 2011 3 000 € en 2012 y 1 500 € en 2013. Se aplica en las tres principales regiones productoras: Extremadura Andalucía y Castilla y León.
- Medidas con financiación nacional:
En cuanto a medidas nacionales al margen de la PAC se han aplicado los siguientes programas con dotación nacional:
  - El Programa de Desarrollo Rural en Comarcas Tabaqueras aprobado en octubre de 2010 destinado a dinamizar y diversificar las economías de estas zonas a través de la búsqueda de alternativas económicas al cultivo. El montante total ascendió a casi 9 millones de euros que fueron distribuidos entre las regiones productoras de Extremadura Andalucía y Castilla y León.
  - Un Convenio de colaboración en octubre de 2011 con la Junta de Extremadura para la dinamización de los municipios tabaqueros de Extremadura. El Convenio cuenta con un presupuesto de 9 millones de euros y tendrá vigencia hasta 2013. Incluirá actuaciones que permitan el apoyo a sectores que contribuyan a mantener la base económica y el empleo en el territorio afectado por la reestructuración de las ayudas al tabaco.","Se trabaja en lo referente a alternativas económicamente viables en colaboración con el Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Medio Rural y Marino"
