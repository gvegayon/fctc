Comment 1: El impuesto que debe pagarse al Fisco se determina por la diferencia entre el débito y el crédito fiscal que estén debidamente respaldados por comprobantes y registrados en la contabilidad de los contribuyentes.

El monto del impuesto se determina por ejemplo aplicando el 13% sobre el precio neto de la venta. que incluye el impuesto selectivo de consume cuando las mercancías de que se trate estén afectas al mismo o cualquier otro impuesto. A este resultado se le resta el crédito fiscal. dando como resultado el impuesto por pagar o saldo a favour sobre el precio neto de venta. que incluye para estos efectos el monto del impuesto selectivo de consume.
Comment 2: La base sobre la cual se debe aplicar la tasa del impuesto que corresponda. se determina de la siguiente manera: a) En la importación o internación de mercancías. adicionando al valor CIF aduana de ingreso. los derechos de importación y el Impuesto de Estabilización Económica efectivamente pagados.

"55","Gambia","The Gambia has several types of taxes for tobacco products. For cigarettes this includes import duty (20% Cost Insurance and Freight (CIF)) import sales tax (15% CIF plus duty) excise tax (165 dalasi per kilo) environment tax customs processing fees and 0.50% ECOWAS levy. For other tobacco products the excise tax is exempted; environment tax is increased to 75 dalasi per kg with the rest remaining the same as cigarettes resulting in lower taxation level of the other tobacco products. Over the recent years there is modest increase of tobacco taxation but the retail price has remained stable. Given the inflation rate is about 4.5% there is actually a real decrease to tobacco products which makes them more affordable and accessible. Increased tobacco taxation is one of the most effective demand side reduction measures particularly for the poor and the youth. The Gambia is in the process of introducing 15% ad valorem rate (VAT) tobacco tax next year but the excise taxation should also be considered. The Gambia Ministry of Finance and the Gambia Revenue Authority recognizes that price and tax measures are an effective and important means of reducing tobacco consumption and supports progressively higher taxation on tobacco products.

IEPS). es de 160% sobre el precio al detallista (componente ad valorem) más 0.35 pesos por cigarro o por 0.75 gramos (componente fijo o específico). El componente fijo del IEPS se introdujo en 2010. año en el cual fue de 0.04 pesos por cigarro o por 0.75 gramos. A partir de 2014. los puros y otros tabacos labrados hechos enteramente a mano están exentos del pago del componente fijo.","La tasa impositiva por el concepto del Impuesto Especial sobre Producción y Servicios para los cigarros labrados y puros ascendió a 140% en 2007 150% en 2008 y 160% desde 2009 y a la fecha. Actualmente los únicos tabacos que mantienen una tasa impositiva menor son los tabacos labrados hechos enteramente a mano de la siguiente manera: 26.6% en 2007; 28.5% en 2008 y 30.4% en 2009.
 El Impuesto al Valor Agregado se incrementó del 15 al 16% desde enero del 2010 y este impuesto permanece en ese nivel hasta la fecha. 
De acuerdo al Decreto del IEPS para el ejercicio 2010 este impuesto se estableció en 160% y se preveía el pago de una cuota adicional que se incrementaría anualmente a lo largo de cuatro años bajo en siguiente esquema: $ 0.80 pesos en 2010 $ 1.20 pesos en 2011 $ 1.60 en 2012 para un incremento total de $ 2.00 en 2013. 
Aunque en su momento se consideró como un avance marginal toda vez que el incremento fue muy modesto y se consideró la gradualidad contraviniendo las mejores prácticas la Ley del IEPS 2010 tuvo la virtud de que permitió fijar un gravamen bajo la figura de una cuota específica por cigarrillo enajenado en México. Como se ha señalado si bien en 2010 esta cuota específica fue muy modesta (cuatro centavos por cigarrillo) y además se consideró la gradualidad de su incremento el establecimiento por Ley de esta cuota específica constituyó la base del incremento que el Congreso aprobó para el 2011.
El Congreso de la Unión aprobó en 2010 la Ley del Impuesto Especial a la Producción y Servicios del 2011 incrementando la cuota específica a $0.35 por cigarrillo enajenado lo que representó un incremento del 26 % respecto al precio de venta del 2010 con lo que .la carga fiscal de los productos de tabaco en nuestro país se ubicó a partir del 2011 en 69.2 %.
De conformidad con el comportamiento histórico de la elasticidad-precio de los productos del tabaco en México se estimó una caída del 13.2% de la demanda por estos productos respecto del 2010 congruente con la disminución en el volumen de ventas reportado al segundo trimestre de 2011 por las tabacaleras particularmente Philip Morris una vez descontado el efecto del agotamiento de acumulación de inventarios antes de la entrada en vigor del incremento de la cuota específica a $0.35 pesos por cigarro enajenado. 
Así mismo la Ley del IEPS 2011 derogó el Artículo Cuarto Transitorio del Decreto de la Ley del IEPS 2010 que era el que contemplaba la gradualidad en el aumento anual de la cuota específica a partir del 2010 y hasta 2013 para un incremento total en 2013 de diez centavos por cigarrillo enajenado o importado (dos pesos por cajetilla).
La Ley del IEPS 2011 no consideró la indexación de la cuota específica a la inflación.

A partír del 2001 se acordó la homologación paulatina de las tasas impositivas aplicadas a los cigarros. En 1986 se alcanzó la tasa impositiva más alta y los cigarros se gravaron con una tasa del 180% misma que se mantuvo hasta 1988 para disminuir hasta el 85% en 1995 conservándose esta tasa hasta el 2000 en que subió a 100%. En 2006 a los cigarros se gravaron con una tasa de 110% fijándose nuevos incrementos escalonados así para 2007 fue de 140% sobre precio de venta al detallista aumentando a 150% en 2008 y a 160% en 2009. 
 A partír del 2001 se acordó la homologación paulatina de las tasas impositivas aplicadas a todos los cigarros y se aprobó una tasa impositiva para los cigarros labrados y puros de 140% en 2007 150% en 2008 y 160% en 2009 los únicos tabacos que mantienen una tasa impositiva menor son los tabacos labrados hechos enteramente a mano de la siguiente manera: 26.6% en 2007; 28.5% en 2008 y 30.4% en 2009.
 Es de destacar que no obstante haber logrado homologar las tasas para los cigarros y los tabacos labrados en el ejercicio fiscal de 2009 no se logró llegar al 180% de IEPS establecido para los años 1986 1987 y 1988.

En el año 2005 el impuesto a los cigarrillos por concepto del Impuesto Especial sobre Producción y Servicios (IEPS) se fijó en 110 por ciento equivalente a 45 5 por ciento del precio final a los consumidores. Si se añade el valor por concepto del Impuesto al Valor Agregado (IVA) - aplicados en casi todos los bienes y servicios en México la presión fiscal para los cigarrillos en ese año fue equivalente a 59 por ciento del precio final a los consumidores.

Excise tax is levied on excisable goods produced in Montenegro and excise goods which are imported in Montenegro.

According to recent amendments of the Law on to the Excise Tax the specific excise tax on cigarettes have been increased from 15 € per 1000 pieces (0.30 € per pack) to € 17.50 (0.35 € per pack) and a proportional reduction in the rate from the current 36%  to 35% of the retail price of cigarettes in order to gradually approach a binding minimum amount of excise tax in the EU according to which the minimum amount of excise duty on cigarettes may not be less than the amount corresponding to 57% of the retail price of cigarettes in the most popular price range provided that the amount cannot be under 64 € / kg. Since 1st January 2014 mandatory minimum in the EU will be 90 € / 1000 pcs. Or  60% of the weighted average price of cigarettes.

 The way of determining minimum excise tax is prescribed by applying the average retail selling price of cigarettes (''weighted average price'') instead of until now ''popular prices'' as basis for calculation of minimum excise tax on cigarettes.
The weighted average retail selling price of cigarettes is calculated by comparing total value of all cigarettes placed on the market (based on retail price including all taxes) divided by total amount of all cigarettes placed on the market in previous year.","The first amendments to the Act was made in late 2008 Year and referred to the further harmonization of existing solutions to the acquis communautaire in particular with EU Council Directive 92/79 / EEC and 92/80/EEC concerning the determination of the amount of excise tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products.

 Specific excise increased while ad valorem decreased. In order to obtain the better transparency of all obligation for tax payers it was decided that the specific reimbursement (so called “budget''s dinar”) on all tobacco products according to the Tobacco Law would be abolished and integrated into the specific excise on cigarettes (the last value of the this specific reimbursement in 2012 was 1.66 RSD per package of cigarettes).
Since October 2012 there is a following tax system on tobacco products:
Period
Specific excise on domestic and imported cigarettes 

October 1 2012 to June 30 2013
43.00 RSD/pack

July 1 to December 31 2013

Since July 1 2016
58.50 RSD/pack

 
Excise on cigarettes is paid per package of 20 cigarettes and if the package is other then the package of 20 cigarettes the excise is proportional to the number of cigarettes in the package.
The ad valorem excise on cigarettes is 33% of the retail price of cigarettes no matter of the period. The base for ad valorem excise tax is a retail price of cigarettes that is determined by producer or importer.
The excise tax on cigars and cigarillos (tariff code CT 2402 10 00 00) is paid as specific amount. In 2012 the excise tax was 18.78 RSD/peace and in 2013 - 21.07 RSD/per peace. 
For smoking tobacco and other tobacco products the excise tax is determined by period of implementation such as following:
- until December 31 2012 - 35%;
- January 1 to December 31 2014 - 37%;
- January 1 to December 31 2014 - 39%;
January 1 to December 31 2015 - 41% and
From January 1 2015 - 43%.
The base for excise calculation on smoking tobacco and other tobacco products je retail price per kilogram and for those that are in the packages other that 1 kilogram excise tax is proportional to the package. 
Since October 2012 VAT has been increased from 18% to 20%.","In relation to question 2.8.1: 
 Law on excises demands paying excises on tobacco products (cigarettes cigars cigarillos smoking tobacco and other tobacco products) according to paragraphs 40a 40b 40g and 40d of the law. This applies to all tobacco products produced in the country as well as to imported tobacco and tobacco products. If the calculated excise on cigarettes cigars cigarillos smoking tobacco and other tobacco products is smaller than the minimal excise according to this law the minimal excise will be paid.
The minimal excise is:
 1) on cigarettes - 100% of the total excise from articles 40? and 40b of the law established for this category of cigarettes with the most popular price.
2) on cigars and cigarillos - 100% of the total excise from article 40g established for the category of cigars and cigarillos with the most popular price.
3) on smoking tobacco and other tobacco products (cut tobacco pipe tobacco chewing tobacco and snuff) - 100% of the total excise from article 40d established for smoking tobacco and other tobacco products with the most popular price.
The most popular price is the retail price of those price categories of cigarettes cigars cigarillos smoking tobacco and other tobacco products that have the biggest sale in the Republic of Serbia in the last half year period.
The latest Decision on the amounts of the most popular prices and minimal excises for tobacco products was adopted in February 2011. It states that the most popular price category for cigarettes is 90.00 RSD per package and the minimal excise for this price category is 57.50 RSD per package . [26.00 RSD per package (Specific excise) + 31.50 RSD per package ad valorem excise (35% on retail price of cigarettes)] The overall tax burden - excise and VAT for the most popular price category of the cigarettes that cost 90 RSD per package is 79.13% in which excises (specific and ad valorem) make 63.88 % and VAT 15.25%. VAT is paid on turnover of tobacco products in the country and the VAT for imported tobacco is 18%.
In relation to 2.8.2: 
Republic of Serbia has mixed system of cigarettes taxation - there is specific and ad valorem excise. The law regulates different amounts of specific excises depending on the period. In the period from January 1 to December 31 of 2011 excise was 26.00 RSD per package and starting January 1 2012 specific excise is 30 RSD per package. Ad valorem excise is 35% of the retail price of cigarettes. Excise on cigarettes is paid per package of 20 cigarettes and for the cigarettes in other kinds of packages excise is proportional to the number of the cigarettes in those packages. Base for calculating the ad valorem excise is the retail price of cigarettes determined by the manufacturer or the importer of cigarettes.	
Specific excise on cigars and cigarillos is 17.55 RSD per piece (the last harmonized amount from January 2011). Excise on cigars and cigarillos is paid per piece.
Excise on smoking tobac","In the period 2008-2010 Serbia applied the following excise taxation system for tobacco products:
Cigarettes were under mixed taxation system (specific excise + ad valorem excise). The amounts of specific excise and ad valorem excise were:
- In 2008 from February 1 to 14 - 7.70 RSD per package and 33% of the retail price of cigarettes and from February 15 to December 31 - 8.48 RSD per package and 33% of the retail price of cigarettes. The change in the amount of taxes was not due to the law change but to the regular yearly harmonization of excise with growth rate of retail prices.
- In 2009 from Januray 1 to 29 - 8.92 RSD per package and 33% of the retail price of cigarettes. From January 30 to May 7 2009 specific excise remained the same but ad valorem excise grew to 38% of the retail price of cigarettes. From May 8 to the end of the year - 12.00 RSD per package and 35% of the retail price of cigarettes. In this year amounts and rates of excises were changed twice due to the change of the law.
- In 2010 from January 1 to January 22 - 17.00 RSD per package and 35% of the retail price of cigarettes and from January 23 to the end of the year there was specific excise of 17.27 RSD per package and ad valorem excise of 35% of the retail price of cigarettes. The change in the amount of taxes in 2010 was not due to the law change but to the regular yearly harmonization of excise.
Taxation system and excises on cigarettes cigars cigarillos smoking tobacco and other tobacco products (cut tobacco pipe tobacco chewing tobacco and snuff) in the period from 2008 to 2010 were not changed. There was ad valorem excise of 33% of the retail price per kilogram in 2008 and partly in 2009 when the new rate (that is valid today) of 35% was established. In 2008 and the beginning of 2009 there was also ad valorem excise of 33% of the retail price per piece. The law was changed in the end of January 2009 and specific excise was introduced for the above mentioned tobacco products. According to the new law the specific excises in 2009 were 14.50 RSD per piece and 15.50 RSD per piece. In 2010 the excise was 15.74 RSD per piece.
It should be noted that the part of the Law on excises regulating different cigarettes excises depending on the period was changed in the end of 2010. Implementation of these changes started on January 1 2011. The excise from January 1 to December 31 2011 was 26.00 RSD per package and from January 1 2012 specific excise is 30 RSD per package. Ad valorem excise is 35% of the retail price of the cigarettes."

"150","The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia","Answer from the Customs Administration:
Until 12.07.2012 the combined excise tax was 35 % of the retail price and 0.10 MKD denars per piece. A minimum amount of excise duty has not been applied. With the amendments to the Law on excise duties the combined excise was accounted for 9% from the retail price and 1 30 MKD denars per piece. If the combined excise is below the amount of 1 50 MKD denars per piece a minimum excise tax is applied in that amount.

Answer from the Ministry of Finance:
For the purposes of fiscal policies in order to support economic growth in June 2013 unification of excise duty on tobacco products was proposed regulated by the Law on excise taxes and fees on tobacco products regulated by the Law on Environment Law on tobacco and tobacco products and Law for healthcare by transforming the tobacco fees into combined excise. With combining the excise and fees on cigarettes from 1.07.2013 the taxation will be on:

1 July 2013 (Ad valorem 9%+specific 1 3 MKD denars min. 1 5 MKD denars)
1 July 2014 - (Ad valorem 9%+ specific 1 45 MKD denars min. 1 65 MKD denars)
1 July 2015 - (Ad valorem 9%+ specific 1 6 MKD denars min. 1 8 MKD denars)

The main reason for initiating the amendments of the Law on Excise was a need to improve the excise policy in several segments. Considering the gradual increase in excise duty on certain products to countries in the region and the need for gradual adjustment to the level of excise taxes in European Union countries a gradual increase in excise taxes on tobacco products in the Republic of Macedonia have been proposed. 
This is in order to raise the excise tax in the country for tobacco goods that in the future should be comply to reach levels of excise specified in the European Union. At the moment there are no socio - economic conditions for accession to directly comply with the EU directives and hence in order to protect the living standards of the population the approach taken is to access to a moderate increase of the excise burden on tobacco. Increases in the amount of excise tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products is also aimed at reducing the consumption of these products and the protection of public health in the country.","Answer/report not provided","Answer/report not provided"
