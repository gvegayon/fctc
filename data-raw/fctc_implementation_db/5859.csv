Municipal Police Communal Police and the State Sanitary Inspectorate follow the application of Articles 15 16 prohibiting smoking in enclosed public places. 
The Minister of Health on 02 August 2012 has set up a task force nr 2 for the implementation of the law (for the control of the smoking ban in public places). The purpose of this order was to create the model for the state inspectorate of how they should work to implement the law. The task force was successful but this model was not implemented on State Sanitary Inspectorate.
 But the law is not implemented still yet but is raise awareness.","Responsible for the implementation of this article are: State Sanitary Inspectroate Municipality and Commune Police.
Municipal Police Communal Police and the State Sanitary Inspectorate follow the application of Articles 15 16 prohibiting smoking in enclosed public places. 
Only in Tirana there are working around 300 municipal police officers and around 60 state sanitary inspectors. One of the reasons for not applying the Law to ban smoking in public places has to do with the fines. The manner of levied fines in 2010 was not effective.
In 2011 the Ministry of Health made a change in the Law for a new collection of fines by creating a standard model prepared in order that these penalties have a sheet serial number.
Financial penalties are settled at the State Sanitary Inspectorate and their value flows to the state budget (nr.10279 law dated 20.05.2010 On Administrative Offences as amended).
In accordance with the law nr.10279 dated 20.05.2010 On Administrative Offences (changed) when the fine is not paid within the specified time (the first month of the date of receipt of the decision-final penalty) it is expected another month (the second) but for every day of delay (in the second month) the penalty increases to 2 percent of the value up to 30 days (Article 34 of Law 7643 dt.02.12.1992 the amended).
After this deadline the law enforcement nr.10279 dated 20.05.2010 On Administrative Offences (as amended) the State Sanitary Inspectorate is legally obliged to send the penalty decision in the Court of First Instance to be transformed into an executable order and and as an executable the bail is sent for execution.
What has the Ministry of Health done for the above? In the Nr.10279 Law enforcement was approved the Guide On the practice of unified administrative offenses punishable by fine. Nevertheless it was concluded that the interventions required by the Ministry of Health has not succeeded in establishing and levying of fines so the work of its subordinate structures is insufficient and ineffective.
As a results of Minister of Health on 12 August 2011 a taks force was set up for the implementation of the law (for the control of the smoking ban in public places). The order was valid for 6 months which contributed to the creation of a model on how the state inspectorate should work for the implementation of this law. There were put 230 fines and all these fines are being collected which was not the case before. The taks force was succesful in its mission.","Answer/report not provided"
