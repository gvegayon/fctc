"31","Chile","Durante el año 2012 se realizo un Estudio de Opinión Trabajadores de restoranes y pubs frente a ambientes 100% libres de humo de tabaco IPSOS Chile. 2012
Este estudio tuvo por objetivo:- Conocer la opinión de trabajadores de restoranes y pubs frente a la propuesta de ambientes cerrados de uso público 100% libres de humo de tabaco. Se obtuvo una muestra de Meseras y Meseros de Santiago que trabajan en lugares para fumadores y restoranes que tienen espacios diferenciados. Los temas tratados fueron: el conocimiento de la ley vigente. su percepción de cumplimiento. y las ventajas y desventajas que aprecian en la implementación de una nueva normativa- .Conclusiones: El 88% de los trabajadores de restoranes y pubs opina que la exposición al humo de tabaco que emiten otros fumadores es dañina para la salud individual. Y en esto están de acuerdo trabajadores fumadores y no fumadores. no existiendo diferencias según el lugar en el que trabajen. Es un consenso el daño que se genera a los fumadores pasivos. También existe amplio acuerdo sobre los beneficios de implementar una normativa que privilegie los espacios públicos 100% libres de tabaco.
 Durante el año 2013 se realizo el estudio de opinión - Nuevos Aires para Chile Evaluación e Impacto en los Hábitos de las mujeres en espacios públicos 100% Libres de Humo de Tabaco- . IPSOS. Chile. 2013
 Este estudio tiene como objetivo: Conocer como la aplicación de las modificaciones de la Ley 19.419 (que actualiza la normativa chilena frente a los compromisos del Convenio Marco para el Control de Tabaco). impactan en las conductas y hábitos de las mujeres chilenas en espacios cerrados donde anteriormente sí se podía fumar y conocer la opinión de ellas respecto a las nuevas normativas. 
Dentro de las principales conclusiones específicas se observa lo siguiente:: 
 La prohibición de fumar en pubs. restaurantes. discotecas y casinos de juegos es la que alcanza mayor nivel de desacuerdo (24%). sin embargo y a pesar de ser la que despierta menos consenso. sigue teniendo un alto nivel de aprobación entre la población estudiada (68% de las mujeres está de acuerdo o muy de acuerdo con la medida). 
 En relación a la -Percepción de impacto de las Modificaciones a la Ley-
Es destacable que la mayoría de las entrevistadas piense que el consumo de tabaco disminuirá mucho o algo (51%). Si bien existe un alto porcentaje de mujeres que piensa se mantendrá igual. los efectos positivos en la disminución del consumo son mayoritarios.
Como conclusiones generales se observa:
 - La entrada en vigencia de las modificaciones a la ley de consumo de tabaco en espacios públicos. tiene una amplia aceptación por parte de las mujeres. destacando que la aprobación sea igualmente mayoritaria entre las mujeres consumidoras de tabaco y en aquellas que no fuman.

- Las modificaciones son percibidas como un aporte. principalmente en la protección de la salud de las personas que no consumen tabaco. debido al conocimiento del daño que sufren los fumadores pasivos en estos lugares públicos.

- La percepción de disfrute de la experiencia en los lugares que antes se fumaba. como pubs. restoranes y discotecas ha mejorado considerablemente después de la prohibición de hacerlo. lo que se percibe tanto entre fumadoras como no fumadoras. Esto implica que hay una aceptación de la ley no sólo en términos de los beneficios de salud. sino que también de la posibilidad de tener una mejor experiencia en un ambiente cerrado libre de tabaco.

- Si bien la percepción de impacto es mayoritariamente positiva en la mayoría de los ámbitos evaluados. existe una menor percepción positiva respecto del impacto que la ley tendrá en la vida nocturna y en la venta de locales donde está prohibido el consumo de tabaco.

- En este escenario positivo del estudio. se observa que las mujeres del grupo etario más joven (18-25 años). tienen un menor conocimiento de la ley. lo que . mediante la exploración cualitativa. que existe no sólo una valoración positiva en término espaciales respecto de los ambientes 100% libres de humo de tabaco. sino que también existe una valoración. por parte de las fumadoras. de las implicancias que esta indicaciones han tenido en su consumo de tabaco:

The GATS will provide the baseline data & estimates of the prevalence levels of awareness about tobacco laws etc. The information will be used for prioritizing the activities under the NTCP & for evaluating outcomes of the program.
The writing of the GATS report is underway and data will be released in mid-September 2010.
The other surveys used are the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) and the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS)."
"67","Iran (Islamic Republic of)","I.R. Iran has conducted a number of surveys on tobacco consumption both among the youth and adult population. I.R. Iran conducted the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) in 2003 and 2007 the Global Health Professional Survey (GHPS) in 2007 the Global School Personnel Survey (GSPS) in 2007 and the STEPs survey in 2004 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 and 2011. The STEPs surveys were conducted with the Government''s own funds. 
According to the 2011 STEPs the prevalence of tobacco use among the adult population aged 18 to 64 years in 2011–2012 was 22.06% for males 1.26% for females and 11.79% in total; prevalence of water pipe (shisha) daily use was 4.7% for males and 2.3% for females Smokeless tobacco is not commonly used. The Statistical Center of Iran has similar data. 
Comparing the 2003 and 2007 GYTS among youth aged 13–15 years the overall prevalence of any tobacco use increased dramatically from 13.0% to 26.6% (among boys 33 

from 17.6% to 32.9% and girls from 8.9% to 19.5%). Smoking prevalence has increased from 2.0% in 2003 to 3.0% in 2007 (among boys from 3.2% to 5.1% and among girls 1.0% and 0.9% respectively) the prevalence of other tobacco use increased from 12.1% to 26.1% (among boys from 16.0% to 31.9% and girls from 8.7% to 19.5%). The main form of any other tobacco use in I.R. Iran is shisha. This alarming increase of Water Pipe among young people deserves immediate attention and effective intervention. In addition the 2007 GYTS showed relatively high levels of exposure to tobacco smoke with 44.8% of students are exposed to tobacco smoke in public places. 

The non-communicable disease program within the Ministry of Health and Medical Education runs two national registries: the myocardial infarction and the cancer registry where tobacco use is the main risk factor for these diseases. 
Statistical Centre of Iran (SCI) coordinates data collection and analysis in the country. The SCI conducts annual household surveys which include information on expenditure on tobacco consumption. The SCI is working with the HQ to estimate the annual consumption of tobacco products in order for the HQ to make an informed decision about the amount for tobacco production and importation. 
Universities and research institutions are actively involved in tobacco-related research. Isfahan Cardiovascular and Health Promotion Research Centre has published more than 25 articles in peer-reviewed journals on different areas of tobacco use in I.R. Iran including the methodology for evaluating implementation of the Convention in the country.","Answer/report not provided","Answer/report not provided"

There is no data base or system but data are gathered annualy and published if available in the annual report that covers the topick of substance use and consequences among Latvian population (The prevelance and cosequences of dependency inducing substances in Latvia). Consequences of smoking are monitored trough national cancer register data which contains data on morbidity and mortality from malignant tumours (such as lung cancer and oral cavity cancer). A comprehensive surveillance of various aspects of tobacco control was developed during the implementation of Transition Facility Twinning Light project Tobacco monitoring system. Within the monitoring system the annual exchange of information is ensured.
