In November 2009 the Council of Youth Ministers endorsed the EU Youth Strategy (2010-2018) which is is cross-sectoral and transversal strategy outlining eight fields of action. One of these fields of action is young peoples health & well-being. Promoting healthy lifestyles is part of the aim in this domain.
In line with the evidence-based approach to youth policy in the EU Youth Strategy the Commission has led an expert group on indicators in the youth field. Indicators for all fields of action of the strategy are proposed. In the domain of health & well-being one of the indicators is the share of daily cigarette smokers for the age-group 15-24. Displaying latest available Eurostat data for this indicator in a general dashboard on young peoples situation in the EU will increase public knowledge and awareness to the issues relating to young people and the use of tobacco.
2. The EU Commission carried out EU wide awareness raising campaigns called Help. Following on from the first Help campaign (2004-2008) Help 2.0 (2008- 2010) targeted primarily young people and young adults. The general motto is providing help and support for a life without tobacco by delivering comprehensive information on health and social problems related to tobacco consumption. It was an integrated campaign including television the internet and new media such as mini-sites accessible through mobile phones. The whole campaign was web driven the objective being to draw young people to the Help website where they can get all the information on the dangers of smoking as well as the links to our partner organisations such as the European Network of Quitlines. The website is available in 22 languages and the web and media campaign has been completed by a series of European and national public and press relations events. As a public health initiative Help proved to be inovative in a number of ways: It was the first EU health campaign in which young people were directly involved.

The QUIT campaign was launched in June 2011 after 12 months of research planning testing and development. The Campaign''s primary focus is on smokers in the 25 to 39 year age group with a bias toward those from a C2DE background – however the campaign messages are relevant to all smokers from all demographics. Health professionals are also an important target for this campaign. Key Tasks completed to date include:
•	Development of campaign identity/brand 
•	Implementation of detailed advertising strategy and media plan for 2011/12/13 and 2014: TV Radio Online Outdoor PR local regional and national 
•	Implementation of a detailed public relations plan to support the campaign
•	Enhanced promotion of smoking cessation support services – National Smokers'' Quitline Website smoking cessation clinics. Improved quality and distribution of printed quit materials now available in HSE locations GP surgeries Pharmacies and Dental Surgeries nationwide
•	Development of a new social media online quit support page on Facebook (over 79 000 likes)
•	Use of HSE owned media e.g. use of campaign brand/messages on stationery emails internal staff information and billboards on various HSE owned sites due to be delivered in 2014.
•	Support of the development of HSE Tobacco Free Campuses 
•	Engagement and support sought and received from internal and external campaign stakeholders.
The most recent element of the campaign was launched on March 5th 2014 (ASH Wednesday) which featured a powerful unique and emotive message from Gerry Collins from Greystones in Co. Wicklow who was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer caused by smoking. Gerry and his family generously volunteered to be part of this new phase of our QUIT campaign in the hope that his story would inspire and encourage smokers to quit. Sadly Gerry died three days before the TV adds were due to air. Gerry''s QUIT campaign adverts were created on the shared understanding with Gerry and his family that they would continue to be used after Gerry had died and the Collins family decided that these adverts should be aired as planned in accordance with Gerry''s wishes. The media and press response to Gerry his family and their story has been unprecedented for any social marketing campaign mounted by the HSE in recent years.","In 2009 a radio billboard and television campaign was launched which targeted parents and guardians encouraging them to think about how their smoking effects and influences their children. This campaign continued in 2010.

It began as a Tobacco Roundtable effort within the Ministry of Health and our partners as well as a focus group with youth. A campaign titled “Our Future Doesn''t Depend on Tobacco” was also conducted within elementary schools in response to the traditional Council of Chief''s Declaration to ban tobacco products. “Our Future” featured presentations and posters given to the schools. We also began to target pregnant women and nursing mothers through a poster and brochure. The design has “onesies” with the ailments babies can get from a mother who is using tobacco during pregnancy or breastfeeding and the caption reads “if you are using tobacco during pregnancy or breastfeeding you are giving your baby something other than love.” Contact information for information or quitting tobacco use was printed on the poster.A youth-oriented FaceBook page was started (SMART KIDS) that now has close to 900 “friends”. Prevention messages have also been developed with the Palau National Olympic Committee targeting athletes.  Non-governmental organizations have also contributed to education communication training and public awareness activities.  We have continued to observe World No Tobacco Day annually which encompasses several activities usually spanning the month of May. In 2013 Palau observed a tobacco tax theme in order to raise awareness on this issue. WNTD was followed by a National Workshop on Tobacco Taxation for policy makers. In 2013 we also began to collaborate with other substance abuse prevention and non-communicable disease prevention programs to conduct events such as a Summer Bash Concert New Lifestyle Talent Show and NCD Outreach to schools.

"136","Singapore","Identifying developing and sustaining partnerships is key to the implementation and effectiveness of programmes. The Health Promotion Board actively engages educational institutions private workplaces the uniformed services health professionals youth organisations community and religious groups and parents to promote a smoke-free lifestyle. Partnership is often in the form of capacity building and consultative service to improve knowledge and skills pertaining to tobacco control as well as providing assistance in the organisation of implementing appropriate tobacco control programmes for various target audiences. 
Health Professionals
HPB partners with health professionals in many aspects of tobacco control and smoking cessation. Through a structured smoking cessation training programme called Certification for Quit Smoking Consultants (CQSC) developed by HPB doctors nurses dentists pharmacists and other allied health professionals are equipped with the skills and knowledge to provide opportunistic smoking cessation advice to patients. Basic smoking cessation training around motivational interviewing is also provided for medical dental pharmacy and allied health students at institutes of higher learning.
 
HPB works in collaboration with Singapore''s restructured hospitals (owned by the Government but run as a private company and receiving a government subsidy) in funding inpatient and outpatient smoking cessation programmes to aid smokers to quit. Smoking cessation services are also available at more than 150 healthcare touchpoints in the community such as at retail pharmacies and primary healthcare settings. 
Workplaces
The workplace is a natural opportunistic setting to reach smokers since two out of every three Singaporeans work. Thus HPB partners workplaces to provide a supportive social environment conducive for quitting smoking through the development of smoke-free policies and initiatives. This includes implementing a structured 3-month Workplace Smoking Control Programme (WSCP) that aims to help employees who smoke quit the habit successfully to achieve better health finances and productivity at work.
HPB also works with the uniformed services such as the police and armed forces to develop and implement smoking cessation programmes specifically tailored to their needs and setting. This includes programmes to provide smoking cessation mentors access to smoking cessation services and capacity building.
Youth Programmes
Recognising that the long-term health effects of smoking do not always resonate with young people HPB launched the “Live it up without lighting up” (LIUWLU) initiative in 2009 targeted youth aged 13 – 23 years. The initiative highlights the benefits of being tobacco-free focussing on 4 areas that resonate with youth namely appearance fitness spending power and the environment. Several programmes and activities have been rolled out under LIUWLU. 
Since 2011 HPB has been engaging commercial partner using the LIUWLU theme. The LIUWLU messages can be included in publicity and collateral materials (eg music CDs magazines online platforms and ambient displays) emcee pointers and poster displays put up at commercial youth-centric events. Besides the messages HPB also had tobacco-free rovers distributing educational collaterals and encouraged smokers to stub out at the partner events. It is estimated that about 380 000 youth were reached out to via the various LIUWLU partner initiatives.
As the LIUWLU campaign theme is favourably received among youth LIUWLU will be the mainstay for youth-targeted tobacco control efforts. 
Community 
Aside from preventing smoking initiation among the youth we also need to focus on encouraging existing smokers to quit smoking. To this end HPB launched the I Quit Movement in June 2011 to inspire smokers to quit using testimonials and role models and tapping on support networks. Advocacy is an important focus of the I Quit Movement and HPB has also been working with various partners such as grassroots organisations and VWOs to create a culture of advocacy on tobacco control issues through capacity building sessions and consultations. Furthermore the I Quit Movement also leverages new media to create a network of online citizens who support smokers who are trying to quit. Quitters are further supported by partnering pharmacies polyclinics and hospitals in the community which provides cessation counselling services by certified quit consultants. Since the launch of the I Quit movement there has been a three-fold increase in the numbers of smokers who seek help to quit. 
The I Quit movement is complemented by the Blue Ribbon Smoke-Free Movement which is part of the larger smoke-free movement that the World Health Organisation (WHO) Western Pacific Region (WPRO) has embarked on. HPB''s Blue Ribbon smoke-free movement launched in March 2012 focused on prevention of second-hand smoke through a smoke-free environment and recognises businesses and communities for voluntarily declaring themselves smoke-free and advocating for smoke-free living. Currently 14 mosques 13 food centres 7 hotels 6 parks and 3 constituencies have been recognised for practising a voluntary smoke-free ban and advocating for a smoke-free lifestyle.

Under the umbrella of the Blue Ribbon Smoke-Free Movement in January 2014 one constituency introduced the first ever community-led smoke-free zone as part of the broader initiative to denormalise tobacco use in the community. This one-year initiative aims to improve the air quality in the communal spaces of the zone by encouraging smokers to smoke only at the six Designated Smoking Points (DSPs) located within the zone. This is on top of complying with the smoking prohibition law that is enforced for the list of premises and areas that are covered under the law. The success of the initiative will be evaluated after one year.

Social Service Offices have also been engaged to provide information on smoking cessation and the available touchpoints to smokers who seek financial assistance.","Identifying developing and sustaining partnerships is key to the implementation and effectiveness of programmes. The Health Promotion Board actively engages educational institutions private workplaces the uniformed groups healthcare professionals youth organisations community and religious groups and parents to promote a smoke-free lifestyle. Partnership is often in the form of training and consultative service to provide knowledge and skills pertaining to tobacco control as well as providing assistance in the organisation of appropriate tobacco control programmes for various target audiences. 
Healthcare Professionals
HPB engages with and partners healthcare professionals in many aspects of tobacco control and smoking cessation. General practitioners nurses dentists and allied health professionals are trained to provide opportunistic smoking cessation advice to patients. Additionally HPB works in collaboration with 6 restructured hospitals in funding inpatient smoking cessation programmes at these hospitals as well as a pregnancy outpatient programme at KK Womens and Childrens Hospital.
Smoking cessation services are also available at different touchpoints in the community such as at retail pharmacies and polyclinics. Through a structured training programme in Smoking Cessation developed by HPB nurses pharmacists and other healthcare professionals are equipped with the skills and knowledge to provide quality smoking cessation advice at these touchpoints. 
Workplaces
The workplace is a natural opportunistic setting to reach smokers since 2 out of every 3 Singaporeans work. Thus HPB is working with workplaces to provide a supportive social environment conducive for quitting smoking through the development of smoke-free policies and initiatives. This includes implementing a structured 3-month Workplace Smoking Control Programme (WSCP) that aims to help employees who smoke quit the habit successfully to achieve better health finances and productivity at work.
HPB are working in collaboration with various uniformed groups such as the police and armed forces to develop and implement smoking cessation programmes specifically tailored to their needs and setting. This includes programmes to provide smoking cessation mentors access to smoking cessation services and capacity building.
Youth Programmes
Recognising that the long-term health effects of smoking do not always resonate with young people HPB launched the Live it up without lighting up (LIUWLU) initiative in 2009 targeted youth aged 13 - 23 years. The initiative highlights the benefits of being tobacco-free focussing on 4 areas that resonate with youth namely appearance fitness spending power and the environment. Several programmes and activities have been rolled out under LIUWLU. For example the programmes and media initiatives of the National Tobacco Control Campaigns 2009 and 2010 revolved around the LIUWLU theme. 
In 2011 HPB stepped up its partner engageme","Partnerships are key to the implementation of programmes. Health Promotion Board actively engages educational institutions private workplaces the uniformed groups healthcare professionals youth organisations community and religious groups and parents to promote a smoke-free lifestyle. Partnership is often in the form of training and consultative service to provide knowledge and skills pertaining to tobacco cotnrol as well as providing assistance in the organisation for appropriate tobacco control programmes for various target audiences. 
Health care professionals are HPBs major partners. We also train pharmacists general practitioners optometrists and dentists to provide opportunistic smoking cessation advice to patients. Workplaces are also excellent platforms to develop comprehensive and sustainable programmes to address issues affecting the health and health behaviors of the working population. In addition we also work with various uniformed groups namely Singapore Police Force and Singapore Arms Forces and the Singapore Civil Defence Force to implement smoking control programmes. Through these partners we had put in place several measures such as partial smoking bans within army camps annual health awareness talks and smoking cessation services. 
HPBs public education programmes for youths focus on equipping young people with knowledge skills and strategies to discourage tobacco use as well as promoting a smoke-free lifestyle as the preferred norm. HPB has worked closely with the Ministry of Education to include information on smoking in the school curriculum in topics such as Health Education Science and Civics and Moral Education. Smoking control messages are weaved appropriately into a variety of other programmes that complement the school curricula. HPB also coordinates competitions and project work that allow students to delve deeper into smoking-related issues. In addition through its Youth Advolution for Health Programme HPB provides consulation and funding support for youth to organise tobacco control programmes targeted at their peers. 
Efforts to raise public awareness include the month-long National Smoking Control Campaign held in conjunction with World No Tobacco Day on 31st May. Annually HPB organizes community events such as roadshows street marches carnivals and public performances to promote a tobacco-free lifestyle. Mass and online media platforms such as television radio blogsites and social networking media are used to disseminate smoking control messages. Information is also creatively woven into articles on personal grooming fitness and financial matters to provide different perspectives on the benefits of leading a smoke-free lifestyle.
In addtion customised intervention programmes are designed for specific groups. For example to tackle the relatively higher smoking rates among the Malay community HPB partners with mosques and Malay/Muslim organisations to promote a smoke-free life"

Coordinación estatal de programas de prevención del tabaquismo y de asistencia sanitaria en tabaquismo llevados a cabo en las Comunidades autónomas. para evaluar su eficacia a través de buenas prácticas. de forma que puedan ser utilizados en otras regiones. Dichas actuaciones se enmarcan dentro del plan de actuaciones del Observatorio para la Prevención del tabaquismo.
Puesta en marcha de la Estrategia de Promoción de la Salud y Prevención de la Enfermedad en el Sistema Nacional de Salud. mediante la cual se generan y evalúan intervenciones encaminadas a impulsar estilos de vida saludables. y en la que la prevención del tabaquismo tiene un papel fundamental.

En general. se persigue profundizar en una mayor cobertura de los programas. así como llegar a otras edades y colectivos. Se han desarrollado programas comunitarios que buscan una mayor sinergia entre los recursos sanitarios y no sanitarios. con el fin de desnormalizar el consumo de tabaco. 
Algunos planes regionales de prevención y control del tabaquismo se han actualizado una vez finalizada la ejecución del plan anterior. incorporando como novedades la identificación. motivación e implicación activa de grupos poblacionales en situación de alta vulnerabilidad. el refuerzo del abordaje de género tanto en los programas preventivos como asistenciales. así como la sensibilización de los adultos sobre la importancia de no proporcionar tabaco a menores.
Además se está impulsando la evaluación de la eficacia de los programas y de las intervenciones sanitarias y no sanitarias. así como la implantación de buenas prácticas.
Por último. en el año 2013 la Federación Española de Municipios y Provincias (FEMP).a través de la red Española de Ciudades Saludables. concedió apoyo económico a los Ayuntamientos en el Marco del Acuerdo de Colaboración entre el Ministerio de Sanidad.

En concreto. en su Línea de Apoyo I. se incluye el apoyo financieramente a los proyectos relacionados con la prevención del consumo de tabaco.","Durante los dos últimos años no sólo se han desarrollado nuevas actuaciones informativas y de sensibilización en el ámbito comunitario educativas de ámbito escolar y formativas sino que también se ha profundizado en una mayor cobertura de programas ampliando el alcance a otras edades colectivos de riesgo y grupos vulnerables entre los que destacan los jóvenes y las embarazadas.
Ha habido colaboraciones entre las diferentes administraciones y entidades cívicas que trabajan con colectivos en situación de riesgo de exclusión social incidiendo en los colectivos de máxima vulnerabilidad como son los jóvenes y adolescentes. En todas las comunidades autónomas y ciudades autónomas ha habido una especial atención a las acciones educativas dirigidas a la reducción del inicio del consumo en población infantil y a la promoción de la deshabituación en dicha población. En esta línea han aumentado el porcentaje de centros escolares aulas y alumnos participantes en programas de prevención del tabaco y con el desarrollo de nuevos recursos con nuevas tecnologías (internet y redes sociales) se han renovado las actividades dirigidas a los adolescentes.
Con el fin de mejorar la efectividad de las acciones educativas favoreciendo sinergias entre diferentes programas ha habido iniciativas de articular la oferta de actividades para la prevención del tabaquismo en población escolar en una cartera de actividades de prevención de tabaco en la escuela así como iniciativas de crear y coordinar distintas redes de centros educativos comprometidos con la prevención del tabaquismo en los jóvenes.

Por otra parte se ha incrementado la oferta de cursos de formación ofrecidos a los colectivos modélicos y la edición de materiales informativos que se les hace llegar a estos colectivos.
También se ha avanzado en la realización de programas de prevención y formación en el medio laboral. 
Una línea importante ha sido la de informar a la población general sobre las consecuencias del tabaquismo pasivo y sobre su derecho a respirar aire no contaminado por humo del tabaco así como el potenciar la norma social de no fumar.

During the strategy period. according to the strategy above. new research findings on the impact of ANDT on health should be disseminated to the general public. The aim during the strategy period should be to introduce innovative and target group-oriented measures to enhance public awareness of the adverse health effects of ANDT. Since the last report submission this measures unfortunately have included only alcohol and not tobacco. 
One measure during the strategy period is aimed at school personnel. Research has shown that schools in Sweden find it difficult to implement a tobacco-free school playground and tobacco-free school hours. The Swedish National Agency for Education has arranged different educational efforts for principals and other school personnel during 2012 to 2014. The Agency has also produced material to support teachers in their teaching concerning these matters.
In 2011 the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (NBHW) published national guidelines for methods of preventing disease. to support governance and management of health care. The guidelines cover tobacco use. The NBHW has provided support to organizations for health professionals to disseminate knowledge of the guidelines among their members and engage their members in the implementation of the guidelines. A Web based training on tobacco cessation has been developed (read more. 3.2.8.14).
During 2013 the government have arranged conferences on addiction to Alcohol. narcotics. doping and tobacco.","In March 2011 the Riksdag passed a coherent strategy for alcohol narcotics doping and tobacco (ANDT) policy aimed among other things at facilitating central government governance of support in this area. The strategy states the goals and direction of how society´s measures are to be implemented coordinated and followed up in 2011-2015. The measures are described in the Governments annual action plan for ANDT policy.
One of the priority objectives for the strategy period is greater awareness among the population of the health impact of ANDT use.

"162","United Kingdom","A new marketing strategy for England was launched in 2012 covering the period 2012-2015. This strategy set out the following marketing objectives:
To contribute to reducing smoking prevalence in England marketing needs to play three roles:
1. Boost smokers'' motivation to quit - by reminding people of the harms of smoking and addressing their low sense of personal risk
2. Trigger significant numbers of quit attempts - with a focus on the largest groups of smokers i.e. cold turkey quitters and where prevalence is highest i.e. routine and manual smokers
3. Help people quit successfully - by providing products to support them and signposting them to further help and support. The strategy set out three pillars of key activity:
•	Smokefree homes and cars campaign The Smokefree Homes and Cars campaign was first run in 2012 and then again in summery 2013. The campaign achieved the highest campaign awareness since 2005 and successfully changed both attitudes and behaviours around smoking in the home and car as well as triggering significant numbers of quit attempts. Smokefree Kits further boosted people''s chances of quitting successfully.
•	Stoptober: Stoptober was a ground breaking new campaign in 2012 (that also ran on 2013) – a new 28 day mass participation event to help England''s smokers stop. The campaign used a new insight (you''re 5 times more likely to stop successfully if you make it to 28 days) and ideas from behavioural economics including ''chunking'' and social norming. This was also our first campaign where social media played an integral part. The campaign surpassed expectations in terms of sign ups and caught the public imagination. 
•	A return to health harms (Jan-March 2013 and 2014): Insight research suggested that the key reasons that motivation to quit and quit attempts have declined in recent years are that people have a lower perceived personal risk of the health harms of smoking and a belief that it is possible to smoke ''responsibly'' and not harm others forgetting that their smoking is harming themselves. A key plank of our 2012-15 Smokefree marketing strategy therefore was to return to health harms advertising. We launched this with our first campaign in support of this strategy – ''mutation'' – which showed a tumour developing on a cigarette with the line ''If you could see the damage you wouldn''t smoke''.","2010/11 was a transitional year for the tobacco control marketing programme as we moved from the 2008/2010 marketing strategy towards a new marketing strategy which will be published in 2012.
Marketing objectives:
Our marketing objectives were to:
- Trigger action: Encouraging smokers who want to quit to do something now and make a quitting-related action. e.g. set a quit date find out more about NHS products and services.
- Make quitting more successful: Encouraging the use of NHS products and services when quitting and exploring ways of reducing relapse.
- Reinforce motivation: Continuing to maintain a positive enviroment for quitting and providing powerful reasons for why smokers should quit for good.
Target audiences:
The primary audience for our activity was:
 - All smokers who want to quit particulary those in routine and manual group.
- Pregnant women who smoke and their partners.
Secondary audiences/ intermediaries included:
- Healthcare professionals including GPs practice nurses and midwives.
- Employers of large numbers of routine and manual smokers.
Our main focus was to continue to provide information and advice on quitting to smokers through out a government wide marketing freeze using free owned and earned channels as far as possible. We did this through channels such as the Smokefree website Facebook page and helpline as well as the Smokefree Together programme and Quit Kits and distributing information literature to smokers and healthcare professionals. 
We ran proactive quitting campaigns in New Year 2011 and 2012 promoting the NHS Quit Kit. The Quit Kit was distributed pharmacies and the NHS Smokefree website. Promotion was bolstered by support provided by pharmacy partners e.g. point of sale posters in store annoucements features in consumers magazines and online display advertising.
The 2011 Quit Kit campaign achieved excellent results:
- We produced and distributed around 350 000 Quit Kits over 70 000 via the Smokefree website and the rest through pharmacy partners.
- In follow up research 70% of smokers who received a Quit Kit made a quit attempt with 56% of those reporting they had stopped smoking at the time of research.
- Quit success increased by 150% compared to 2010. Those who picked up their Quit Kit pharmacy had the most success with NRT also having had influence.
-We estimate the campaign generated 186 324 attempts and 104 233 successful quits.","Historically marketing communications activity focused solely on motivating smokers to quit. Following a comprehensive marketing review a new strategy for England was developed for 2008-10 with a particular focus on routine and manual smokers who smoke at much higher rates that the general population.
The approach uses campaigning and marketing to encourage smokers who want to quit to take action; encourages those who have taken action to use NHS support to quit and highlights reasons why smokers should quit. The three key marketing objectives are:
- Triggering action: Encouraging smokers who want to quit to do something now and make a quitting-related action (e.g. set a quit date find out more about NHS products and services).
- Making quitting more successful: Encouraging the use of NHS products and services when quitting and exploring ways of reducing relapse.
- Reinforcing motivation: Continuing to maintain a positive environment for quitting and providing powerful reasons for why smokers should quit for good.
These marketing objectives are underpinned by six major workstreams which cover work directly with the public and also with stakeholders.
1. Acquisition and lead generation: to stimulate quit attempts and drive significant volumes to all the NHS response channels (e.g. website or helpline).
2 Stakeholder activation: to use third party influencers to generate quit attempts amongst routine and manual smokers who can be reached in environments inaccessible to commercial media. Stakeholders include healthcare professionals employers and community representatives.
3. Lead management and conversion: to convert those responses generated from the acquisition activity into successful quit attempts through customer relationship marketing programme and improved interaction with the helpline and other response vehicles.
4. Product development: to enhance and develop the NHS support offering for quitters. This included the Quit Kit launched in Dec 09 aimed at triggering quit attempts in smokers who would not otherwise be interested in NHS support and the new Quit Club workplace support offering.
5. Reinforcing motivation: to drive the desire to quit using advertising PR sponsorship and partnership to provide reasons for both stopping smoking and positive reasons for wanting to become smokefree.
6. Community activation: using a broader range of media channels and tactics to influence smokers within their communities e.g. using field marketing to engage smokers on the street in conversations about quitting supported by stop smoking advisors with promotion of these events through local networks.. 
In England there are nearly 5 million quit attempts each year. Econometric modelling has demonstrated the relationship between tobacco control marketing activity and people quitting smoking. In 2008 and 2009 tobacco control marketing activity directly stimulated over 1.5 million quit attempts and over 100 00 successful quits e"
