"51","Fiji","Answer/report not provided","Fiji has implemented a few studies concerning tobacco use prevalence in the past 12 years. 
Fiji conducted the 1st round of the national NCD STEPS survey coordinated by WHO in 2002. This survey has a section on tobacco use and provides information on tobacco use prevalence among 15-64 year-olds. According to the 2002 STEPS report daily smoking prevalence was 26.9% for males (53% reported being current smokers) and 4.8% for females (18% current smokers); overall 36.6% of the population reported being current smokers. 
WHO provided financial and technical support for training on STEPS surveys to Fiji and the country is currently working on the implementation of the 2nd round of the survey. Data collection was completed in October 2011. This will make Fiji the first Pacific island country to repeat STEPS. 
Fiji conducted the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS) twice in 1999 and 2005 obtaining information on tobacco use and exposure to tobacco smoke among school children aged 13-15 years. GYTS 2005 shows that 11.5% of students currently use any form of tobacco products; this was a slight increase from the 1999 GYTS.18 In addition 47% of students live in homes where others smoke in their presence. 
Fiji also implemented the Global School Personnel Survey (GSPS) in 2005. 
A group of researchers under the coordination of Fiji School of Medicine in cooperation with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) collected data and knowledge on tobacco use and on sources of information concerning tobacco matters. A representative sample of 457 individuals (aged 12-82 years) from the central division of Viti Levu were surveyed. Results of the study were published in the Pacific Health Dialogue in 1999.19

The data were provided by a population of 12 520 who were asked six questions in relation to current and previous use of tobacco whether smoked or chewed and of betel nut use. The data showed that 24.71% of respondents (44.1% male and 5.0% female) smoked or had ever smoked cigarettes or other smoked tobacco products; 7.44% (12.2% male and 2.6% female) chewed or had ever chewed tobacco including Copenhagen and other snuff; and 7.84% (14.4% male and 1.37 female) chewed or had ever chewed betel nut including betel nut with tobacco.
The Behavioural Health Epidemiological Profile 2012 was as endorsed by the Government in April 2013. has been published. These data show that the adult smoking rate in 2012 was 26% for males and 2.7% for females. Further information on the location time of day and type of tobacco used is also available from this source.
RMI also conducted the GYTS in 2009 and the WHO STEPs Survey in 2002.
The 2009 GYTS indicated that 17% of boys and 10.6% of girls aged 13–15 years were current smokers while 22.6% of boys and 15.8% of girls used other tobacco products. 9.3% of young people aged 13–15 years were susceptible to initiating smoking.
Data from the Youth Risk Behaviour Survey (YRBS) conducted in 2003 2007 2009 and 2011 showed higher use with one third of high school students having smoked on one or more days in the previous month. Trend data showed a peak in 2003 and a plateau at 30% since 2007. Daily use has trended down since 2003 with 16.4% of students indicating daily use. Lifetime use has also trended down from 70% in 2003 to 63% in 2011.
RMI implements the Synar policy that tracks retailer violations of the ban on sales to minors. From a high of 99.1% in 1999 this has now dropped to 18.7% of retailers violating the law in 2013.
There is a wealth of data available in RMI although the comparability and reliability of the data are difficult to determine. For example the 2011 census data show male smoking at close to 60% which is almost three times higher than the data from the Behavioural Risk data.","Yes we have implemented the following tobacco surveys: NCD STEPS Survey in 2002; GYTS in 2009; the RMUI Individual Survey in 2010; and the Youth Risk Survey in 2009.","Answer/report not provided"
