"67","Iran (Islamic Republic of)","Article 18 of the Act requires the Iran Tobacco Company to comply with the national standards in production and supply of tobacco products. The Iran Standard and Research Institute (ISRI) developed 57 standards for tobacco products in accordance with the relevant ISO standards and required testing for tar nicotine carbon monoxide alkaloids and nitrate. These tests have been agreed with Iran Tobacco Company. Due to lack of laboratory facilities for the testing of tobacco products in ISRI and the Ministry of Health and Medical Education the testing of tobacco products is carried out either in the laboratory of the Iran Tobacco Company or in a foreign laboratory chosen by the industry. 17 

The Bylaw in its Article 22 mandates the Ministry of Health and Medical Education to provide the necessary facilities and laboratory equipment for the assessment of the materials and compounds contained in and emitted by tobacco products. Due to the current sanctions against I.R. Iran access to sophisticated laboratory equipment causes problems in equipping reference laboratories for the Ministry of Health and Medical Education. 
The Conference of the Parties at its fourth and fifth sessions adopted partial guidelines for the implementation of Articles 9 and 10 of the Convention which Parties can use to develop their own regulations and standards. 
According to the needs assessment of the FCTC some gaps identified in implementation of Articles 9 as follow: 
1. The partial guidelines for the implementation of Articles 9 and 10 adopted by the Conference of the Parties have not been used in the development of the national regulations and standards concerning contents emissions and disclosures of tobacco products including the banning of additives as a strong public health measure. 
2. The national standards on tobacco products are limited to the scope of constituents to harmful constituents such as tar nicotine and carbon monoxide. 
3. The competent authority does not have exclusive laboratory facilities for the testing of tobacco products.","Indicator not used","Indicator not used"
