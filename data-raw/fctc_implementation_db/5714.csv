"64","Hungary","In September 2012 the Parliament adopted the Act on „Reducing Smoking Prevalence among Young People and Retail of Tobacco Products”. also known as the “Tobacco Shop Law”. In consequence of the Act. selling of tobacco products can only be permitted in supervised tobacco stores. where only adults above 18 can purchase. The aim of the Act is to restrict the widespread availability and presence of tobacco products in order to promote tobacco control among young people. furthermore to supply smokers with tobacco products professionally and satisfyingly in compliance with consumer protection rules. thereby to prevent the illegal trade of tobacco products.
As a result of the Act. from 1st July 2013. tobacco products can only be purchased in 7000 supervised tobacco stores with concession. instead of in more than 40 000 shops all over the country before. At retail. young people need to be prevented from buying tobacco products as much as possible. If there is a doubt about the age of the customer. the retailer must check the documents proving the age of the customer. In case of contravening these requirements. the consumer protection agency can impose a fine on the tobacco product retailer. 
On the outer walls of the tobacco store it is prohibited to display any picture or visualization relating to tobacco products or smoking. As a result of these measures. purchasing tobacco products has become more difficult for young people. 
Results of Youth Surveys in 2012 and 2013
The youth surveys in 2012 and 2013 were conducted within the WHO Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS). Respondents of the surveys were pupils in the 7th. 8th and 9th grades in the age group of 13-15. 
In 2012 the rate of current – both daily and occasional – smokers was 27%; 31% of boys and 25% of girls smoked. This rate decreased by 3% in 2013. The decrease was observed among boys: the rate of current smokers among boys fell to 24% by 2013 and there was no change among girls.
In 2012. 7% of the age group of 13-15 were daily smokers. that is. 9% of boys and 5% of girls. The rate of current smokers among young people rose to 9% by 2013. The increase was 1% among boys and 2% among girls.
In 2012. 45% of young people bought cigarettes in shops; this rate decreased significantly to 20% by 2013. In 2012. 43% of young people were not prevented by shop assistants in service from buying cigarettes because of their age. this rate unfortunately increased by 2013: 50% of the age group of 13-15 were not refused during service because of their age.
The Adult Tobacco Survey 2013 contains that 58% of the smokers said. that it is more or much more difficult to buy a tobacco product than before decreasing the number of the tobacco-selling places.
Four important measures on tobacco control implemented since 2012 in Hungary:
smoking ban in enclosed air space public places and in some of the open air space places. the significant tax increase on cigarettes. the warnings combined with pictures on cigarette packages and the drastic decrease in the number of stores selling tobacco products.
A significant decline of the prevalence among adults and slight decline of the prevalence among the youth occurred related to the four measures.
The reduction of the number of smokers is expected to help reduce tobacco related morbidity. mortality and tobacco related economic and social burden.","No further steps have been made in the implementation of Article 16. in the reporting period.","The sale of tobacco products form vending machines is prohibited from 1st September 2006."

"136","Singapore","Answer/report not provided","Since the last update we have introduced 2 new administrative requirements to discourage sales of tobacco products to minors. These are: 
(1)1st time errant licensees or employees will be prosecuted and errant licensees will have their tobacco retail licences revoked if they were found to sell tobacco products to youth in school uniforms and to those who are obviously underage. 
(2)Tobacco sales at premises whose primary business is the sale of health related products as well as those that offer youth-centric products or services have been prohibited since April 2011. These include Chinese medical halls health supplement shops as well as game arcades confectionaries candy comic and toy stores. HSA has set up a consultative panel comprising healthcare professionals and civil representatives to help in the review of grey area businesses which do not fall cleanly into one of these prohibited categories.
In addition the composition fines for underage smoking offender was increased from S$30 to S$80 to further deter underage smoking and prosecution is initiated at the 5th and subsequent offences to reduce the number of offenders prosecuted in the Juvenile Court. First time underage smoking offenders are also given the option of undergoing an online smoking cessation counselling which seeks to discourage them from continuing to use tobacco products.","The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) is the primary agency overseeing the enforcement of laws and regulations relating to underage smoking and the issuing of tobacco retail licences. 
HPB collaborates with the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) to regulate tobacco licensing point of sale displays and equip retailers with skills to refuse tobacco sales to underage youth. The prohibiton of imitation tobacco products tobacco vending machine distribution of free tobacco samples to public and the prohibition of sales of tobacco to underaage use was implemented from 1993. A first offence contitutes a sum of up to $5 000 and up to $10 000 for subsequent offences. 
Prohibitive signages at all tobacco retail outlets and the prohibition of sales of tobacco by underage youth was implemented in 1998 and finally the prohibiton of sale of cigarette packs containing less than 20 sticks of cigarettes was implemented in 2003 which completes the implementation of Article 16. New amendments in the Tobacco (Control of Advertisements and Sale) Act will extend the prohibition of cigarettes sold in packs less than 20 sticks to miniature cigars or cigarillos. Tobacco importers and local distributors and retailers will be a given a grace period of 12 months from the date of gazette to effect the changes. 
HPB recognises that the tobacco industry is becoming more creative in their marketing strategies to market new and emerging products which would appeal to the vulnerable groups such as youths and young adults. As such the recent amendments to the Act have taken a pre-emptive step to empower the Health Minister to ban these new and emerging products such as fruit or confectionary-flavoured cigarettes cigarillos beedies and other dissolvable tobacco and nicotine products."
