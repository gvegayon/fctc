With respect to tobacco growing and post-harvest processing reference is made to national standards concerning processing technologies which must be taken into account during the process. 
Agricultural inputs involved in tobacco growing are required to maintain and improve fertility of the soil and to only apply technologies which do not have a negative impact on the environment. Further only fertilizers and phyto-sanitary products registered in the country can be used. During the growing or processing of leaf tobacco standard rules of workers health protection and security should be respected. In this regard employment of minors and pregnant women is not allowed in growing harvesting or post-harvest processing of tobacco. 
Similar rules apply to industrial processing of tobacco including manufacturing of tobacco products (Chapter III of Tobacco Act articles 6 to 9). Again the law forbids employment of minors and pregnant women for manufacturing of tobacco products.","Answer/report not provided"
