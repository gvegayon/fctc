The Australian Government Department of Health is developing a regulation impact statement on options for further implementation of WHO FCTC Partial Guidelines for Article 9 (relating to regulation of the contents of tobacco products) and Article 10 (relating to regulation of tobacco product disclosures). to reduce the harmful effects of tobacco use.","The three tobacco companies involved in manufacturing in Australia (Philip Morris Limited British American Tobacco Australia Limited and Imperial Tobacco Australia Limited) disclose information about the ingredients of cigarettes pursuant to a voluntary agreement with the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing.

The Department is currently commissioning further research on the scientific technical practical feasibility and public health value of regulating disclosure of tobacco product ingredients and emissions data. This research will help inform future consideration of further regulatory options. 
In addition the Australian Government requires public disclosure of information about the contents and emissions of tobacco products through messages required to be displayed on the side of cigarette packs. New requirements were introduced in the Competition and Consumer (Tobacco) Information Standard 2011 which commenced on 1 January 2012 and can be accessed at www.comlaw.gov.au. The new requirements include multiple information messages that are linked to specific graphic health warnings and are required to be rotated in the same manner as graphic health warnings. The information messages were informed by scientific evidence and market research findings and are a mix of both new and familiar information about the toxic chemicals in tobacco smoke and their health effects. Between 1 January 2012 and 30 November 2012 tobacco products can comply with either the Competition and Consumer (Tobacco) Information Standard 2011 or the Trade Practices (Consumer Product Information Standard) (Tobacco) Regulations 2004. From 1 December 2012 all tobacco products must comply with the new Standard.","Australia has commissioned projects to inform future disclosure of emissions ingredients."
