"64","Hungary","Answer/report not provided","In order to receive comparable data from the Parties we suggest to clarify two questions in the reporting format as the questions in their current forms can be answered in two ways:
The question under 3.2.7.2 should be separated as for contents and emmissions for Hungary f.ex. the answers would be different.
The content of corporate social responsibility should be clarified under 3.2.7.2 what are the forms which justify yes answer.","- It would be very useful to present the national reports in one database not just separately and so doing it would be possible to search data with the built-in searching and filtering functions on the WHO website.
- In the Report we suggest the division of the 3.2.5.12. question into two different questions: 
.............packaging and labelling of such products contain information on relevant constituents of tobacco product? Yes No
.............packaging and labelling of such products contain information on relevant emissions of tobacco product? Yes No
Justification: In Hungary for example there is data only for emission not for constituents on the packages. It would be relevant to have the answer for each of them separately.
When preparing the previous report we were not provided by the step by step instructions. This is the reason for some modifications in the answers for 3.2.2. These are not the result of the weakening of the registration. The determination of the categories permitted that we can present our specified national regulation in this years report. (3.2.2)
