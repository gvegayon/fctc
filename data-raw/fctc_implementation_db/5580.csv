Copyright licences can be granted for the images owned by the Australian Government. Licences for the other images will need permission from their owners and may include a fee. 
On 29 April 2010 the Australian Government announced that as part of its 2010/11 Budget $2.6 million (over four years) was allocated to develop and introduce legislation to ensure all cigarettes will be sold in plain packaging by 1 July 2012. This will remove one of the last remaining forms of cigarette advertising.	The legislation will restrict or prohibit tobacco industry logos brand imagery colours and promotional text other than brand and product names in a standard colour position font style and size.
The Government will develop and test package design that will make cigarettes less appealing particularly to young people. Graphic health warnings will be updated and expanded. Research shows that industry branding and packaging design reduce the effectiveness of graphic health warnings on tobacco products."

"95","Mexico","Answer/report not provided","La experiencia de México en el desarrollo de LAS con pictogramas no ha sido diferente de la que se ha documentado en otros países de la región de Latinoamérica y del resto del mundo. Destaca la consolidación de un grupo multidisciplinario de expertos que ha contribuido a construir la capacidad nacional necesaria para dar sustentabilidad al programa de LAS con pictogramas.
Los resultados obtenidos en la evaluación a través de grupos focales de las leyendas de advertencia sanitaria y de los pictogramas nos muestran que la información se consideró por la población como Relevante Significativa y con carácter Preventivo. Lo anterior se suma a lo expresado por los fumadores en relación con el hecho que los pictogramas y LAS los motivan a reducir el consumo de cigarrillos cuando no abandonarlo por completo siendo esto consistente con trabajos de la literatura científica que revelan que LAS con pictogramas logran reducir la demanda de productos de tabaco.
También resulta de interés el hecho que entre los fumadores se observó el reconocimiento de los efectos negativos para la salud así como la disposición al cambio de conducta en función de la relevancia de la información presentada en LAS con pictogramas. En México de acuerdo a la Encuesta Nacional de Adicciones 2008 los fumadores consumen en promedio 7 cigarrillos al día lo que representa una buena oportunidad de incidir ampliamente entre quienes consumen una cantidad moderada de cigarrillos y a quienes a través del empaquetado se les puede persuadir para evitar el consumo y cambiar de actitud. Actualmente se reconoce el potencial de LAS para promover cambios de conducta.
En contraparte el estudio preliminar de impacto para seleccionar las imágenes y LAS que contendría el proyecto mexicano muestra que aún subsiste entre algunos fumadores especialmente los más jóvenes la idea de que pueden dejar de fumar cuando ellos así lo decidan. De igual manera se observa cierta resistencia al cambio entre los fumadores que a pesar de reconocer los severos daños para la salud que implica el tabaquismo refieren que continúan fumando por los efectos placenteros que conlleva el tabaquismo. Lo anterior nos confirma la necesidad de continuar con el proyecto de comunicación para neutralizar creencias que obstaculizan la meta de informar mejor a los consumidores sobre los serios daños a los que exponen su salud por fumar o por inhalar el humo de tabaco ajeno así como la información referente a las propiedades adictivas de la nicotina.
Por otra parte en México en cumplimiento a la legislación nacional previo a la publicación de cualquier normativa regulatoria debe celebrarse el proceso de consulta pública en la que cualquier persona física o moral puede opinar. Al analizar el proceso de Consulta Pública del Proyecto de Acuerdo Secretarial para la incorporación de pictogramas y leyendas de advertencia al empaquetado y etiquetado de productos de tabaco en México se hace necesario llamar la atención","Una vez que los pictogramas y mensajes sanitarios se hayan publicado la Secretaría de Salud conducirá un estudio de focal ( focus group) para evaluar el impacto de los mismos .
Con base en el resultado del estudio de impacto de la Primera Ronda de las leyendas sanitarias y pictogramas dará inicio el proceso del diseño de las leyendas sanitarias y de los pictogramas que habrán de conformar el catálogo para la selección de la Segunda Ronda que habrá de incorporarse a partir del 25 de septiembre del 2011 al empaquetado y etiquetado de productos del tabaco."
