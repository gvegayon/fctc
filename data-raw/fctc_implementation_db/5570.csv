So our law is in accordance with the convention and creates free tobacco environments. This article is not yet applied. State Sanitary Inspectorate has been not effective. When the task force nr.2 operated in Tirana the implementation of the law has been 78% effective and also in high level (60%) on national level but this situation was only when the task force operated in Albania. Task force nr 2 started on 02.08.2012 (order 362) and stopped on 22.10.2012 (order no 530). 
On 12.03.2013 the law “On health protection from tobacco products” has made same amendments modifications. Some of the most important modifications on the law 
; Its improved the definition of public place also the definition of workplace.
This article is not yet applied.","In 2011 the Ministry of Health made a change in the Law for a new collection of fines by creating a standard model.
Financial penalties are settled at the State Sanitary Inspectorate and their value flows to the state budget (nr.10279 law dated 20.05.2010 On Administrative Offences as amended).
In accordance with the law nr.10279 dated 20.05.2010 On Administrative Offences (changed) when the fine is not paid within the specified time (the first month of the date of receipt of the decision-final penalty) it is expected another month (the second) but for every day of delay (in the second month) the penalty increases to 2 percent of the value up to 30 days (Article 34 of Law 7643 dt.02.12.1992 the amended).
After this deadline the law enforcement nr.10279 dated 20.05.2010 On Administrative Offences (as amended) the State Sanitary Inspectorate is legally obliged to send the penalty decision in the Court of First Instance to be transformed into an executable order and and as an executable the bail is sent for execution.
What has the Ministry of Health done for the above?
In the Nr.10279 Law enforcement has emerged the Guide On the practice of unified administrative offenses punishable by fine .As a results of Minister of Health on 12 August 2011 a taks force was set up for the implementation of the law (for the control of the smoking ban in public places). The order was valid for 6 months which contributed to the creation of a model on how the state inspectorate should work for the implementation of this law. There were put 230 fines and all these fines are being collected which was not the case before. The taks force was succesful in its mission.","Answer/report not provided"

"21","Brazil","In December 15th. 2011. the President has sanctioned a national law prohibiting smoking in public places nationwide. The smoke free measures of this law are not in force due to the lack on its regulation by the Executive.","In Brazil since 1996 there is a Federal Law that prohibits smoking in public enclosed places but allows smoking designated areas and demands them to be properly isolated and ventilated. Different interpretations of the language of the law have allowed different levels of implementation nationwide ranging from a total ban mainly in companies and health-care and government facilities to situations where smoking designated areas and non smoking areas shares the same room. This last situation has been very usual mainly in bars restaurants and other entertainment and hospitality sectors. Another important problem with the current federal law was related to the lack of inspection and the penalties application by sanitary authorities in municipal level what by its turn is a result from the low understanding of second hand smoke as a threat to health by policy makers in local level which dont prioritize this matter. 
Since 2008 two bills of law (BL 315/08 and BL 316/08) related to federal law on smoking in enclosed places are under appreciation in Senate. But they are competitive because while BL 315/08 proposes a total ban and the BL 316/08 proposes to keep smoking designated areas which worsen the current federal legislation on this matter as it takes out the language that establish that the smoking designated areas must be exclusively to smoke. There is a strong lobby from tobacco industry in National Congress to dismiss BL 315 and approve BL 316. 
By the other hand from 2008 on states and municipalities started to approve their own legislation on this matter. Currently 21 states and the Federal District (FD) approved their own legislation. From this total 7 adopted a total ban (following the language of the BL 315) and the other 14 and the FD adopted a legislation following the BL 316 ( keeping smoking designated areas). In municipal level 23 municipalities approved legislation banning smoking designated areas. And 09 approved laws keeping smoking designated areas.The states that banned smoking designated areas are being challenged in court by organization affiliated to tobacco industry under the argument that state and municipal legislation are unconstitucional if more restrictive than the federal law.
