Enero del 2010 se realiza el primer seminario para funcionarios de salud y de salud mental del MINSA de todas las regiones de salud y algunos de la Caja de Seguro Social sobre el manejo de las clínicas con una duración de tres días. También se les brinda este seminario a los miembros de la Red Intersectorial de Salud Mental.
Logros del Seminario:
o	Un participante médico psiquiatra se compromete a iniciar las clínicas la cual se inaugura en el mayo
o	Posteriormente abre la clínica de la Región de Salud de Coclé en Penonomé y hospital Santo Tomás coordinado por la sala 25 de psiquiatría y el servicio de neumología.
El periodo de demora para iniciar la instalación de las clínicas se debió a que en ese momento no se contaba aún con los tratamientos farmacológicos que consistían en Vareniclina welboutrin y parches de nicotina.
Con el esfuerzo paralelo de la Comisión Antitabaco del MINSA que realizaba seminarios en las regiones de salud para capacitar sobre la Ley 13 de 2008 entre otros del control de tabaco se continúo impulsando la creación de nuevas clínicas de cesación.
En el año 2011 patrocinado por OPS se dicta seminario de una semana a funcionarios del MINSA y de la Caja de Seguro Social sobre el manejo de las Clínicas de Cesación de Tabaco. Este seminario se le repitió a las Enfermeras Especialistas de Salud Mental del MINSA y de la Caja de Seguro Social como un esfuerzo conjunto entre la Comisión y el Programa de Salud Mental lo que dio como resultado la apertura de hizo que se iniciaran nuevas clínicas en el nivel local ambulatorio en la región de Salud de Colón Chiriquí Los Santos Veraguas San Miguelito. 
Además se le ofreció a la Caja de Seguro Social que no contaba con la medicación pero sí con el deseo de iniciar las clínicas apoyarlos con la medicación para que en algunas Policlínicas iniciaran o en otras que ya habían iniciado como la Pol. De San Francisco agregaran la medicación.
A la fecha se cuenta con 16 clínicas de cesación de las cuales 1 está en un hospital de III nivel de atención otra en uno de II nivel y el resto en las instalaciones de la red ambulatoria del MINSA o de la CSS. Ambas instalaciones hospitalarias son del Ministerio de Salud.
Se ha atendido 539 pacientes de los cuales 65 abandonaron tratamiento para una tasa de abandono del 12.1%. De los 474 pacientes que continuaron con el tratamiento 4 han recaído para una tasa de recaídas de o 84%.
En cuadro anexo se lista la ubicación de las clínicas de cesación existentes en Panamá.","Los programas de capacitación en las carreras de profesionales de la salud es muy limitada según se evidenció en la Encuesta a Estudiantes de Profesiones de la Salud realizada durante el 2008. Destacamos algunos de los principales resultados:
Al estimar el promedio porcentual considerando al conjunto de estudiantes de todas las carreras de ciencias de la salud que participaron en este estudio se encontró que 1 de cada 4 estudiantes han recibido entrenamiento formal en técnicas de cesación que te facilite su acercamiento con los pacientes fumadores durante su formación como profesional sin embargo es de notar que la opinión de los estudiantes sobre este aspecto fluctúo entre el 18% y 35.9% con valores mínimos entre los estudiantes de farmacia y máximos entre los estudiantes de enfermería. Hubo diferencias estadísticamente significativas entre los estudiantes de enfermería con respecto al resto de los estudiantes de las otras tres carreras que participaron de este estudio; en tanto que no se encontraron diferencias estadísticamente significativas entre estudiantes de medicina odontología y farmacia.
La importancia de proporcionar materiales educativos para apoyar la cesación en pacientes que desean dejar de fumar fue reconocida por el 69.9% del conjunto de estudiantes entrevistados los valores que permitieron alcanzar este promedio porcentual oscilaron entre el 58.4% y el 87.1% ubicándose los valores mínimos en el grupo de estudiantes de odontología y los máximos en los de enfermería. No hubo diferencias estadísticamente significativas entre estudiantes de medicina y farmacia como tampoco entre estudiantes de farmacia y odontología. Por otro lado se identificaron diferencias estadísticamente significativas entre los estudiantes de enfermería y el resto de los grupos estudiados.
En contrapeso a las opiniones relacionadas con haber recibido entrenamiento para cesación destaca que el 95% o más de los entrevistados piensan que deben recibir entrenamiento específico sobre técnicas de cesación sobre el particular es importante indicar que todos los estudiantes de farmacia que fueron entrevistados piensa que deben ser capacitados sobre este aspecto. Más estudiantes que nunca ha fumado que estudiantes fumadores están a favor del entrenamiento específico de técnicas de cesación. Este estudio no identificó diferencias estadísticamente significativas entre las respuestas favorables de los estudiantes de medicina y odontología ni entre los estudiantes de odontología y los de enfermería. Por otra parte se reflejaron diferencias estadísticamente significativas entre los estudiantes de medicina y enfermería como entre los estudiantes de farmacia con respecto al resto de los grupos.
