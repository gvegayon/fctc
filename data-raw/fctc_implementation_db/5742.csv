The Australian Government also provides financial support to help people quit smoking by subsidising a range of medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). These include Zyban (Bupropion) Champix (Varenicline) and nicotine patches (Nicorette Nicabate P and Nicotinell). All of these products are available at a reduced price for eligible patients through the PBS with a prescription from a general practitioner. These subsidies were extended in February 2011 to help to remove cost as a barrier for people who want to quit smoking. 
To be eligible to access nicotine patches through the PBS patients must indicate that they are ready to quit smoking and have entered or are entering a comprehensive support and counselling program that is designed to assist people who wish to quit smoking. Patients can access one 12-week course of the nicotine patches per year. If a patient is unsuccessful in quitting using the nicotine patches they can access the other smoking cessation therapies on the PBS (bupropion and varenicline) during that 12 month period. 
Additional measures are in place to reduce the cost of PBS medicines for eligible Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living with or at risk of chronic disease. The PBS Co-payment Measure which commenced on 1 July 2010 is one of 14 measures in the Australian Governments Indigenous Chronic Disease Package and provides lower or nil patient co-payments for PBS medicines.

"41","Czech Republic","There is a legally binding obligation for health professionals to conduct a brief intervention consisting of the timely diagnosis of abuse among persons who use tobacco products which is incorporated in the above mentioned Act No. 379/2005 Coll. The brief intervention is mostly offered by physicians and increasingly also by nurses. There are specialised courses in place on prevention of harmful use of addictive substances and treatment of addictions is obligatory for all physicians of all branches as a part of specialization trainings (as mentioned already in 3.2.6.8.). The Society for Treatment of Tobacco Dependence (www.SLZT.CZ) provides continuing education in treatment of tobacco dependence for physicians (CME credits of the Czech medical Chamber 2-day courses) nurses (CME credits of the Czech Association of Nurses one-day course) and pharmacists (CME credits of the Pharmacist''s Chamber 2-day course). It provides also education and regular update for nurses and physicians of Centres for Tobacco-Dependent including regular conferences at least twice a year. There is a collaboration of nurses from the General University Hospital in Prague and the Society for Treatment of Tobacco Dependence with International Society of Nurses in Cancer Care (www.isncc.org) which is focused on educating nurses in brief interventions. Most of health professions undergo occasional trainings in treatment of tobacco dependence but it is not systematic. Trainings include treatment of pregnant psychiatric adolescent and other disadvantaged smokers as well.
Guidelines for treatment of tobacco dependence were published for physicians/general practitioners (2005 2006) pharmacists (2010) and nurses (2010). (Available on-line: www.slzt.cz). 
Intensive treatment is offered in the frame of the Centres for Tobacco-Dependent based in hospitals mostly at pneumology cardiology internal clinics - currently 37 Centres across the country (see http://www.slzt.cz/centra-lecby). They are under supervision of the Society for Treatment of Tobacco Dependence.
In terms of coverage of treatment by public funding there are two treatment codes covered by the health insurance companies (60 minutes intervention 30 minutes follow-up visit). The treatment service is free of charge (only 30 CZK/each visit is to be paid as a regular medical office fee) apart from medication for patients. The pharmacotherapy is not reimbursed by health insurance companies only one of them gave support to pharmacotherapy for their clients by up to 4 000 CZK (= about 2 months treatment) in 2014. 
Treatment is also provided by some physicians pneumologists and other medical specialists. It is not systematic. Treatment can be provided also by addictologists (a new official branch of health professionals in the Czech Republic who focus on prevention and treatment of addictive diseases). A new legislation adopted in 2013 allows to cover a treatment provided by addictologists from health insurance system. 
Czech Pharmacist´s Chamber has started with a program “Smoking Cessation in Pharmacies”.
A “Quit line” (number 844 600 500) is available for a reduced charge between 11 – 16 hours during working days. However it is provided by the NGO “Czech Coalition against Tobacco” without any systematic support by the state. Consultants work on volunteer basis.
Campaigns/projects:
There have not been any national specially designed programmes for specific social groups in the past two years. Campaigns/projects were rather generally focused. There were some local events mainly related to World No Tobacco Day organised by several NGOs every year. 
Several hospitals are active in Health Promoting Hospitals/Smokefree Hospitals Program. Smoking cessation may be part of some other community health promotion projects (Healthy Cities etc.) 
Treatment of tobacco dependence is provided also in the Army of the Czech Republic (ACR).

Las clínicas se organizan para atender grupos de 20 fumadores. con un promedio de 10 fumadores por grupo y una efectividad que fluctúa entre 60 y 70% y una tasa de abandono entre 20 y 25%.
Con los fondos recibidos por el MINSA producto del ISC se ha adquirido equipamiento para dichas clínicas por cerca de 300 mil dólares. La inversión en medicamentos para dejar de fumar en el periodo 2010 a 2014 fue de 1.4 millones de dólares y se han adquirido los siguientes medicamentos: Vareniclina 1 mg comprimido; Bupropión 150 mg comprimido de liberación prolongada; Nicotina 15 mg. parche transdérmico; Nicotina 10 mg. parche transdérmico; Nicotina 5 mg. parche transdérmico.

The results of the work of counseling are minimal compared to the results achieved in quitting of smoking because:
 level of knowledge about the harmful effects of smoking in patients smokers are at a low level
Generally patients smokers are unaware of the effects of smoking on the progression and frequent hospitalizations due to basic disease (HOBB astma tuberkuloza etc.)
Motivation to quit smoking is low
In 2012 in a small group of counseling participated 72 people of which 17 expressed wish to quit smoking and 3 quit the smoking.
In 2013 in a group of counseling participated 143 people in total in individual counseling - 19 people and 2 people are still in a phase of not smoking..
The reasons for this situation lies in the facts that:
Smoking has treatment as a socially acceptable form of behavior that does not compromise nor ill person nor his/her family.
Patients are adults with longstanding habits that are difficult to eradicate especially in the condition when there is lack of public disapproval for smoking. 
Ignorance about the harmful effects of smoking results in the fact that people are convinced that smokers can stop smoking whenever they want and when they need help.
The electronic cigarette is deeply entered in the market and is used more as a fashion detail but we still have no formal opinion if we can accept it as a method to stop smoking or not.","Answer/report not provided","Answer/report not provided"

"162","United Kingdom","3.2.8.1-3.2.8.7 (14.1 - 14.2b): A number of programmes and activities to reduce demand for tobacco through tobacco dependence treatment and cessation have been undertaken including programmes and activities outlined briefly below.
Since 1999 the National Health Service (NHS) has run Local Stop Smoking Services (LSSS). These services were a mainstream activity of the NHS located in communities throughout the country. The past two years has seen a shift of the funding and responsibility for delivery of public health to local authorities. This has been to allow a greater level of autonomy for authorities to provide public health interventions in those areas where demand is greatest. One outcome from this localism is that the provision of stop smoking services is no longer mandated with local authorities responsible for setting their budgets to deliver tobacco control measures which they regard as being effective for their population. As the delivery of stop smoking services is non-mandated so is the return of the data that supports their delivery. The inevitable outcome of this measure is that there has been an increase in variability of provided services and return of data however all 152 top tier local authorities have continued to commission stop smoking services and 150 have returned some level of data. The LSSS remit is to provide evidence-based support and treatment for smokers to stop and includes behavioural support and access to pharmacological aids. Local Authorities have been supported to deliver these services to be effective evidence-based and high quality through publication of guidance which supports local commissioners and providers of smoking cessation services.
These services are delivered in healthcare facilities in workplaces in prisons and in mental health facilities as well as in wide range of community settings and in higher education institutions.
In addition where local populations have a need a number of LSSS also provide support and treatment to users of non-smoked tobacco products who wish to quit.
In 2009 a new programme for supporting smokers to quit in the secondary care was launched in England. A number of clinical specialities such as cardiac rehabilitation diabetes care and COPD care have been delivering stop smoking support as part of their health promotion work.
The promotion of tobacco cessation is done both nationally and locally across a wide range of settings supported by marketing activity.
3.2.8.8 (14.2b)
Health professionals in a range of healthcare settings such as primary and secondary care are encouraged to provide brief advice and referral of smokers to LSSS. The health professionals involved in this include doctors nurses midwives dentists opticians pharmacists mental health workers and community workers. The Local Authority has inherited a workforce of trained stop smoking advisors whose main job is to provide smoking cessation.
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has produced smoking cessation guidelines for a number of specific populations including those receiving secondary care and for women who are pregnant or following child birth. The LSSS provide services for pregnant women their partners and for both before conception and after birth.
3.2.8.9 (14.2c)
Although there is some training incorporated in health professional pre and post qualification training at a number professional schools this tends to be ad hoc and is not systemic across educational institutions.
In England the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training (NCSCT) has been set up to support the delivery of smoking cessation interventions provided by local stop smoking services; support the NHS and Local Authorities to deliver effective evidence-based tobacco control programmes and deliver training and assessment programmes to stop smoking practitioners and other health care professionals. As part of its programme of work the NCSCT has identified the competences (knowledge and skills) needed to effectively help smokers to stop and to conduct research into behavioural support given to smokers. The NCSCT has developed training assessment and certification programmes based upon the competences and also provides resources for commissioners managers and practitioners. More information is available at: www.ncsct.co.uk 
3.2.8.10 11 12 (14.2d)
Work to increase the availability of pharmacological aids for smoking cessation has included a range of activities in recent years including: 
- Nicotine replacement therapy bupropion and varenicline is available on NHS prescription to all patients (some people are exempt from paying prescription changes including those on low incomes; pregnant women and those who have had a baby in the last 12 months; and children under 16 and young people aged 16 17 and 18 in full-time education.
- Widening the licence for NRT to include children aged 12-18 pregnant women and those with controlled coronary heart disease.
- Work with MHRA to widen the licence for NRT to include extended usage of products including full substitution resulting in the recently published NICE Harm Reduction Guidance.
- Work with industry to improve the variety dosage and delivery mechanisms for NRT to be suitable for a wider range of patients.
- Work with local areas medicines management to amend local formularies to include wider access to effective medications and usage including varenicline and dual NRT prescribing.","3.2.8.1-3.2.8.7 (14.1 - 14.2b): A number of programmes and activities to reduce demand for tobacco through tobacco dependence treatment and cessation have been undertaken including programmes and activities outlined briefly below.

The promotion of tobacco cessation is done both nationally and locally across a wide range of settings supported by marketing activity. A wide range of more general marketing activities support the promotion of tobacco cessation to the general public and specific target populations such as pregnant women.
