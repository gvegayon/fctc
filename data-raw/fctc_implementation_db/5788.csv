"116","Philippines","On Policy Development
There was an increase in the number of agencies that have adopted the Article 5.3 after the issuance of the CSC-DOH JMC 2010-01. The Department of Education Commission on Higher Education Department of Science and Technology Department of Labor and Employment Land and Transportation Franchising Regulatory Board and the Bureau of Internal Revenue to name a few have issued their respective policies adopting the JMC. Fairly recently LGUs are beginning to adopt the JMC. In 2013 the Municipal Government of Balungao in Pangasinan a tobacco producing province in Northern Luzon adopted the JMC through an Executive Order issued by its Mayor. 
Incidents of TI Interference
The JMC did not instantly deter the industry from interfering with the setting and implementation of tobacco control policies in the different branches of government. Monitoring reports from various tobacco control groups show that the national government agencies continue to experience TI interference. The industry also continue to dissuade local government units from adopting an FCTC compliant ordinance. News in different media outlets report of the assumed partnership between the industry and several elective and appointive government officials. Despite all the reports no formal complaint for violation of the JMC has been filed with the CSC and the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB). Notable however is the gradual decline in the number of TII incidents monitored by allied agencies and partner CSOs.
The presence of the Philippine Tobacco Institute (PTI) in the Inter-Agency Committee-Tobacco (IACT) the implementing body of the Tobacco Regulation Act is a glaring fact that the tobacco industry''s participation in policy development has been institutionalized. The existence of the National Tobacco Administration (NTA) is a matter that needs to be thoroughly studied with the end goal of ensuring that the Philippine government is consistent in its tobacco control policy. 
In the recent past the CSC and DOH received letters from the Northern Luzon Alliance Group seeking the revocation of the JMC. During budget hearings both leaders of said institutions thoroughly questioned by the same members of the Congress about the legality of the JMC.
Enforcing Article 5.3 through the CSC-The Union Project.
The CSC and Bloomberg Initiative agreed to undertake an 18-month Project to implement the JMC. Through the Project the CSC as Co-Chair of the Sector-Wide Anti-Tobacco (SWAT) Article 5.3 Sub-Committee is able to quarterly convene this multi-sectoral tobacco control group to discuss issues on interference and agree on strategies to prevent and address the same. It is currently in the process of developing the Committee''s Strategic Work Plan and Communication Plan. 
Through the CSC the SWAT 5.3 was able to call the attention of the IACT to ensure that no proposal by the Philippine Tobacco Institute should be adopted by the body. Likewise CSC sent letters reminding the department secretaries/ agency heads of the Department of Agriculture Department of Justice and the NTA agencies alleged to partner with the TI to observe the provisions of the JMC. 
The current activities being undertaken by the Project are as follows: a.) On institutional inconsistencies the CSC is studying the feasibility of the NTA being circumscribed in the FCTC as a short-term solution to the conflicting legal framework in tobacco control. b.)Together with in-country advocacy partners the CSC is carrying out activities aimed at capacitating agencies particularly the LGUs in implementing the JMC. c) To sustain the efforts of the project the reporting and monitoring mechanisms to implement the JMC is being integrated in the systems and programs of CSC. Reports of violations can now be coursed through CSC''s helpdesk: Contact Center ng Bayan. d) Partnership with key agencies like the DepEd DILG and OMB is being harnessed for the wide-scale enforcement of the JMC.","DOH and the Civil Service Commission (CSC) have issued a Joint Memorandum Circular No. 2010-01 on June 26 2010 on Protection of the bureaucracy against tobacco industry interference. The DOH previously issued a Department Memorandum N. 2010-0126 on Prohibition on Partnerships with Tobacco Industry and any of its by-products. An Article 5.3 Committee has been established to coordinate efforts to protect public health policies from tobacco industry interests.
