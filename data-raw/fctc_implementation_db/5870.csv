NRT is widely available and sales tax has been reduced to the lowest amount permissible to encourage use.
The Government has undertaken to work in collaboration with the public health community to consider what more can be done to help tobacco users who cannot quit or who are unwilling to to substitute alternative safer sources of nicotine such as NRT for tobacco. In support of this the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has produced public health guidance on the use of harm reduction approaches to smoking cessation. We will also encourage the manufacture of safer sources of nicotine such as NRT and the development of new types of nicotine products that are more affordable and that have increased acceptability for use in the longer term.
