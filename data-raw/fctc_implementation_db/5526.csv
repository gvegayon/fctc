"6","Australia","As part of the National Health Survey in 2011-12. the Biomedical Results for Chronic Disease included a test for cotinine as an objective measure of smoking status. The body produces cotinine in the process of breaking down. or metabolising. nicotine from tobacco smoke. Levels of cotinine are generally proportionate to the amount of tobacco exposure a person receives through smoking. or in some cases. through exposure to second hand smoke. However. cotinine levels only remain elevated for around 20 hours after exposure to tobacco smoke; therefore it can only provide a measure of short-term exposure. Overall. 87.0% of current smokers aged 18 years and over had exposure to tobacco smoke. compared with only 5.7% of those who were ex-smokers and 0.3% of those who had never smoked.","In the State of New South Wales a 2010 report indicated that 92 per cent of adults aged 16 years and over lived in a smoke free home 2.9 per cent lived in a semi-smoking home and 4.5 per cent lived in homes where people frequently smoked. 86 per cent of adults aged 16 and over did not allow smoking in their car. In the State of South Australia a 2010 report revealed that 65.7 per cent of people reported having been exposed to second hand smoke within the past two weeks. Most people reported exposure to second hand smoke outside building entrances. In the State of Western Australia statistics from the 2011 Health and Wellness Survey revealed that smoking is not acceptable to a majority of individuals and that Western Australian residents believe that it is twice as acceptable to regularly smoke at home than to smoke in public. Please see Annex 1 for further information.","Note: Exposure to tobacco smoke is regulated by the individual State and Territory jurisdictions.

Indoor Air monitoring was conducted for thirty minutes at every venue in a sample of hospitals schools public offices transportation and recreation venues. The study took place during July 2010. A total of 18 venues were monitored using PM2.5. A brief summary of the findings from this study is presented here.
In Manama the study found an average PM2.5 level of 211 µg/m3 in venues with evidence of smoking which is 15 times higher than indoor places where no smoking was observed. 

Study Findings 

Levels of PM2.5 in Indoor Places in Bahrain

PM2.5 levels were 15 times higher in venues where smoking was observed compared to venues with no smoking observed and nearly 8 times higher than outdoors.

Smoking was only observed in recreation venues. All other venues had signs prohibiting smoking and very low levels of PM2.5.

The average PM2.5 levels detected in recreation venues with smoking was 211 µg/m3. In only 30 minutes visitors to these venues would be exposed to levels 8 times higher than what is acceptable for a whole day (25 µg/m3) defined by the World Health Organization.6

El objetivo del estudio fue determinar los niveles de nicotina en el aire al interior de lugares públicos como: hospitales. establecimientos educativos. centros del gobierno. centros de transporte. restaurantes y bares en Bogotá. 

Se instalaron 120 filtros. que permitieron monitorear la presencia de nicotina en 75 áreas de los diferentes establecimientos seleccionados. Se detectó nicotina en el aire en el 35% (26 de las 75 áreas monitoreadas). 

Es importante señalar que hay grandes diferencias según el tipo de establecimiento. Los lugares con mayor número de áreas en las que se detectó nicotina fueron los sitios de entretenimiento. como bares y restaurantes. con los mayores niveles de concentración de nicotina (0.89 µg/m3). 

En más de la mitad de los monitores instalados se obtuvieron valores por encima del límite de detección. el cual es de 0.0067 microgramos.

El objetivo del estudio fue determinar los niveles de nicotina en el aire al interior de lugares públicos como: hospitales establecimientos educativos centros del gobierno centros de transporte restaurantes y bares en Bogotá. 
Se instalaron 120 filtros que permitieron monitorear la presencia de nicotina en 75 áreas de los diferentes establecimientos seleccionados. Se detectó nicotina en el aire en el 35% (26 de las 75 áreas monitoreadas). 
Es importante señalar que hay grandes diferencias según el tipo de establecimiento. Los lugares con mayor número de áreas en las que se detectó nicotina fueron los sitios de entretenimiento como bares y restaurantes con los mayores niveles de concentración de nicotina (0 89 µg/m3).
En más de la mitad de los monitores instalados se obtuvieron valores por encima del límite de detección el cual es de 0 0067 microgramos.

Children (0-4 years)/20-36
Children (8 years)/>26","Answer/report not provided","About 18 till 40% of non-smoking adults (age 15+) in the Netherlands are daily exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) from other people. At least 14% of pregnant women are exposed to ETS and at least 7% of unborn children have a mother who smokes. Moreover 20-36% of children in the Netherlands are to some extent exposed to passive smoking. These estimates are the result of an exploratory study of the RIVM which supports the Dutch tobacco control policy (National Tobacco Control Programme 2006-2010).
It is very complex to give a (precise) estimation of the exposure of non-smokers to environmental tobacco smoke in the Netherlands. This is because few information about exposure to ETS in the Netherlands is available and because it is difficult to measure and determine ETS precisely. The estimations are based on data of two longitudinal population-based cohort studies and information from other sources"

GYTS in 2013 revealed that there is a reduction in exposure to SHS among youth: exposed to SHS at home are 63.4% of youth 61.5% boys and 65.4% girls. This is significant reduction since 2008 when 76.9% of youth 73.4% boys and 80.0% girls and particularly since 2003 when 96.4% of youth 95.0% boys and 98.0% girls were exposed to SHS. However even this reduced exposure to SHS is very high.
The same study revealed that 60.9% of youth are exposed to SHS in enclosed public places 53.4% boys and 68.1% girls. Although lower than in 2008 (total 71.9% boys 68.1% and girls 74.8%) it is high and is a consequence of the fact that according to the Law on Protection of the Citizen from Exposure to Tobacco Smoke (2010) there is no a total ban on smoking in the hospitality sector.","National Health Survey 2006 also provided data on exposure to tobaco smoke at home and at work. Although in comparison with the data from the same survey conducted in 2000 the level of exposure showed a decrease still unacceptably high percentage of people was exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke at home (6 out of 10 people) and at work place (45%). Exposure to tobacco smoke at home was higher for woman (62.1%) while men were more exposed at work (49%). The greatest percentage of exposure to tobacco smoke at home (64.6%) and at work (50.5%) was noted in people classified as well-off and those with secondary school education (66.8% and 51.8% respectively). Age-wise exposure to tobacco smoke at home was highest among the 20-30 and 35-44 years age groups.
National Survey on Pre- and Post-Natal Smoking in the Republic of Serbia carried out in 2008 revealed that nearly 7 out of 10 pregnant women were exposed to SHS at home in 2/3 of cases by husband who smoked. (Reference: National Survey on Pre- and Post-Natal Smoking in the Republic of Serbia 2008 CPHA ACSP Public Health Association of Serbia).
In comparison with GYTS 2003 repeated GYTS in 2008 showed 20% reduced but still extremely high exposure of schoolchildren age 13-15 to SHS at their homes (77%) and in other places (72%). 
In May 2010 new smoke-free legislation was adopted in Serbia and fully enacted on 11 November 2011. It is expected that new data of the National Health Survey and other repeated surveys will show the decrease in exposure to SHS in working and public places as well as at home as a result of enforced legislation and increased level of public awareness.","National Health Survey 2006 also provided data on exposure to tobaco smoke at home and at work.

Por otro lado. el estudio de Evaluación del impacto de la Ley 42/2010 en la exposición al HAT en locales de hostelería. mostró que la exposición al HAT en locales de hostelería se ha reducido drásticamente (las concentraciones de nicotina y de PM2.5 disminuyeron en más del 90%).","Un 24.5% de la población de 16 y más años está expuesta al humo de tabaco en su casa. Este porcentaje es más elevado en el grupo de 16 a 24 años en el que alcanza un 38.6% y disminuye de manera paulatina al aumentar la edad (Tabla 1).

"162","United Kingdom","Respondents to the Health Survey for England are classified as non-smokers if they reported not smoking and their cotinine level (measured through a saliva sample) was below 15ng/ml.
Self-reported mean hours of exposure to smoke per week in non-smokers has slightly declined from 3.1 hours for men and 2.8 for women in 2010 to 2.7 for men and 2.5 for women in 2011.","Respondents to the Health Survey for England 2009 were classified as non-smokers if they reported not smoking and their cotinine level (measured through a saliva sample) was below 15ng/ml. Self-reported mean hours of exposure to smoke per week in the non-smokers were 3.4 hours for men and 3.3 hours for women these are comparable to the 2008 reported levels of 3.3 hours per week for men and 2.7 hours per week for women.
Geometric mean cotinine levels in non-smokers were 0.10ng/ml for men and 0.09ng/ml for women. This is a significant fall from the 2008 levels of 0.14ng/ml for men an 0.13ng/ml for women.","The Health Survey for England (HSE) 2008 [N.B to note this is for England only not the United Kingdom] explores secondhand tobacco exposure among non-smokers following the introduction of the smokefree legislation in July 2007. Respondents were classified as non-smokers if their geometric cotinine levels were lower than 15ng/ml and they had reported that they did not currently smoke.
The data show a reduction of exposure to second-hand smoke as indexed by cotinine levels. Indeed geometric mean cotinine levels fell from 0.20 ng/ml to 0.14 ng/ml among men and from 0.19ng/ml to 0.13 ng/ml among women. This reduction was observed across all age groups and the largest reduction was observed among women aged 16-34 (from 0.24ng/ml to 15ng/ml).
Similarly mean hours of exposure to secondary smoke fell after the introduction of the smokefree legislation; they fell from 6.2 to 3.3 hours among men and from 4.4 to 2.7 hours among women. 
The introduction of smokefree legislation in England in 2007 had very little impact on exposure to second hand smoke among children aged 4 to 15. Cotinine levels in the 12 months prior the smokefree legislation was 0.22ng/ml while it was 0.23ng/ml in the 12 months following the smokefree legislation. 
Children indicated their home or other peoples homes as the place where they were often near to people who were smoking. 
Moreover geometric cotinine levels among non-smokers children were higher among those who lived in households where one or more adults smoked regularly (1.49ng/ml) compared to households where no adults smoked regularly (0.14 ng/ml).
