"76","Ireland","The Minister for Finance (Irish Finance Minister) takes cognisance of the Guidelines for the Implementation of Article 6 of the FCTC in preparing Budgetary strategy regarding the taxation of tobacco products and in providing for appropriate tax administration measures to control tobacco products.  In line with the Tobacco Products Tax Directive (2011/64/EU) Ireland operates a mixed system of taxation. In line with the Guidelines, Ireland imposes a relatively high specific component, a relatively low ad valorem component, and a minimum excise duty. With regard to the periodic revisions of tobacco tax levels, successive Ministers for Finance have opted not to index tobacco tax rates, but rather to raise excise duty on a discretionary basis with regard to the exigencies of broader fiscal policy. In eight of the last ten years, Ministers have opted to increase the tobacco products tax, all increases above the rate of inflation. As outlined in 3.2.1.4, the Minister for Finance is aware of the need to ensure a similar tax burden is imposed on all tobacco products. For that reason, duty on fine-cut tobacco has been increased above the pro-rata level imposed on all other tobacco products in Budgets 2012 and 2015. This has brought the ratio of the excise burden on fine-cut tobacco relative to cigarettes from 0.64 in 2011, to 0.69 in 2015. With regard to the apportionment of revenues to tobacco-control programmes, Ireland does provide for the hypothecation of a nominal sum of €168 million of revenue from the Tobacco Products Tax annually to the Department of Health (Irish Health Ministry).    Finally, it should be emphasised that Ministers for Finance make tobacco taxation policy with regard to the overall fiscal stance, so that from time to time, revenue raising may be a greater factor when deciding the quantum of any tobacco taxation increase.","The Minister for Finance (Irish Finance Minister) takes cognisance of the Guidelines for the Implementation of Article 6 of the FCTC in preparing Budgetary strategy regarding the taxation of tobacco products and in providing for appropriate tax administration measures to control tobacco products.
