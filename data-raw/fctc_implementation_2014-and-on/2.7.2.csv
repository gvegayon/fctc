En el descenso en el número de tabaqueros. ha tenido que ver la reforma de la regulación europea del sector. en 2006. que ha supuesto desvincular. de la producción. las ayudas al tabaco. Es decir. actualmente las ayudas se cobran. independientemente de lo que cultives. por referencia histórica y no por kilogramo producido y entregado a la industria (exceptuando la ayuda a la calidad. con un montante muy reducido). 
Este esquema de ayudas. ha supuesto un desincentivo al cultivo de tabaco: desde 2005. la producción y superficie se han rebajado un 17.05% y un 20.58%. respectivamente. El número de cultivadores de tabaco han bajado en un 62.1% (la mayor reducción en el número de activos que en superficie y producción. se explica por un incremento en las mejoras tecnológicas del cultivo).

Puestos de trabajo que genera el sector del tabaco crudo:
En cuanto a los puestos de trabajo que genera este sector. además de los cultivadores. cabe decir que en Extremadura. comunidad autónoma que concentra más del 94% de la producción:
El empleo directo del cultivo de tabaco genera 6.331 puestos de trabajo. incluyendo los cultivadores. los asalariados por labores agrícolas (UTAs. Unidades de trabajo agrario: trabajo efectuado por una persona dedicada a tiempo completo. durante un año. a la actividad agraria). las agrupaciones de productores de tabaco y las empresas de primera transformación.
El empleo indirecto. en esa región. genera 155 puestos de trabajo entre producción y distribución de semillas. distribución y almacenamiento de fertilizantes y fitosanitarios. mantenimiento y reparación de maquinaria. distribución de energía. sistemas de riego. seguros agrarios. servicios financieros. asesoría y otros.

"159","The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia","Around 80 000","Answer not provided","Answer from the Ministry of Agriculture Forestry and water economy:
Republic of Macedonia is ranked on the 30th place for the amount of tobacco produced in the world and on the 15th place in the realized value of export of tobacco in the world.Upon considering industrial crops tobacco prevails among them as a very significant labor-intensive crop in areas with difficult conditions for agricultural production. Out of the total planted area under industrial crops in 2012 73.77 % were planted with tobacco. Most tobacco is grown in Pelagonia and Southeast parts of Macedonia (Radovis and Strumica).The primary production of oriental type small leaf aromatic tobaccos have great economic and social importance for the Republic of Macedonia as a country which is traditional manufacturer of this type of tobacco. From the oriental types of tobacco the varieties grown in the republic of Macedonia are the following: Prilep Yaka Basmak and significantly small quantities of Dzebel. In some years semi-oriental type Otlja is produced. In the period before the year 2004 we had successful growing of broad-leaf tobacco types Virginia and Burley especially the tobacco type Virginia. Our state has abandoned the credentials in tobacco production except the controls established in the Law on of tobacco and tobacco products. For these reasons we believe that Macedonia will remain for the next 7 years almost an exclusive manufacturer of oriental types of tobacco. This conclusion arises out of the fact that there is a lack of state regulation on the quantity and type structure of the produced tobacco by tobacco harvest.
At this point the oriental tobacco is a major export product. Because of its high quality the Macedonian oriental tobacco is greatly valued in the international market and along with the tobacco products it represents an important export product of the country. Today over 99% of the total tobacco production is oriented towards the requirements of multinational companies which through their registered companies for purchase of raw tobacco are ensuring placement of fermented tobacco on foreign markets. At the present time almost all tobacco production is in the hands of individual producers - farmers.The tobacco production in the Republic of Macedonia for the period of the last 3 years (according to data from the State Statistical Office) is presented in Table 1.
