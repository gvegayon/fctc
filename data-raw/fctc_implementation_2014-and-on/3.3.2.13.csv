"126","Poland","Another issue that has been settled in Poland, on the occasion of the implementation of the Directive 2014/40/UE, are the provisions prohibiting sales at a distance, including cross-border sales of tobacco products and electronic cigarettes. The adopted directive is consistent with the principle of prudence regarding the use of a toxic, poisonous substance – nicotine. Moreover, such a solution will introduce significant limitations in the availability of electronic cigarettes and liquids filling minors. With this in mind, all sorts of proposals involving the registration of those making mail-order sales and the introduction of devices that verify the age of the customer, do not deserve acceptance because of the illusory control and inefficiency in reducing the possibility to purchase by unauthorized persons.
Through the implementation of the provisions concerning the ban on distance selling, Poland was also in the group of fourteen European Union Member States which have decided to introduce this type of solution. Undoubtedly, this is an example of the proper clarification of Member States’ cooperation in the field of the protection of the health of young Europeans.","Answer not provided","Answer not provided","WHO European Region"
