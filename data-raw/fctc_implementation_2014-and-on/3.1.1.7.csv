The 2004 amendment brought Austrian tobacco law in line with the European Strategy for Tobacco Control and the WHO FCTC. A general smoking ban in rooms of public places like offices shopping malls theatres means of transport etc. as well as an absolute ban in schools and other facilities where young people are accommodated supervised or educated were introduced. Also a comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship was stipulated. 
Furthermore as of 1/1/2009 major amendments to the Austrian tobacco act entered into force including smoking restrictions (with exemptions) also for hospitality venues. After a transitional period lasting until 30/6/2010 at least 50% of the places of all hospitality venues with the exemption of 1-room-premises with a surface of under 50m² (in certain cases up to 80m² if a division into 2 rooms is forbidden by legal provisions) must be smokefree. If hospitality venues provide more than 1 room for serving guests the main room is in any case covered by a smoking ban. Smoking and non-smoking areas cannot be in one room but only in detached rooms that can be closed with a door. Furthermore hospitality venues have to be marked as smoking/non-smoking or mixed premises at the entrance and also inside. Fines for violations of the smoking bans were introduced for the tenants of the premises (public rooms as well as hospitality venues) as well as smokers.
Furthermore various measures have been and still are undertaken in Austria to reduce tobacco consumption and prevent especially young people to start smoking. On the national level there are series of public awareness media campaigns especially targeted at school children and parents were run (for example: ''Nichtrauchen lohnt sich'' (2010) ''echt cool'' (2011); also on the provincial level there are many campaigns available: f.ex. “Free your mind” (project on smoking prevention for school children in Lower Austria 2013) “PLUS” (national prevention programme for children with focus on legal drugs/tobacco 2013).
