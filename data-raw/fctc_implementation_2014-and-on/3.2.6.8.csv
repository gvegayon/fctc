"7","Australia","The National Tobacco Campaign (NTC) is a vital part of the Australian Government’s comprehensive range of tobacco control strategies and prevention measures, which are designed to work in concert to reduce smoking prevalence levels across Australia.
State and territory governments, as well as Non-Government Organisations also run mass media campaigns in Australia. Campaigns are coordinated with each other to maximise the impact and reduce the time between bursts of activity.  
The following progress has been made in implementing Article 12: 
•	the current NTC ‘Don’t Make Smokes Your Story’ (the campaign) focuses on Indigenous smokers, recent quitters and their families. The campaign aims to empower this audience to quit smoking and promote the use of available support services, such as the Quitline, the My QuitBuddy mobile application and the Quitnow website;
•	the campaign was launched on 29 January 2017 and continued through to 25 June 2017. The media buy for this phase included television, print, radio, digital and out-of-home advertising;
•	a robust public relations strategy was implemented to engage with Indigenous audiences at grass roots level, including participation at the Barunga Festival, NRL and AFL games, the Laura Dance Festival and in-program television promotions such as the Marngrook Football show;
•	evaluation of phase one of the campaign (which commenced on 1 May 2016) was undertaken in July and August 2016 (n=310). The results showed 75% of Indigenous smokers and recent quitters were aware of the campaign. Of those exposed to the campaign, 9% stated they had quit smoking and 27% stated they intended to quit; 

The campaign was effective in conveying messaging to direct smokers to the quit smoking support tools, with a significant majority of respondents agreeing that the campaign directed them to take action by calling the Quitline (71%), visit the website (65%) and download the My QuitBuddy app (58%).

The evaluation report for phase two was undertaken in July-September 2017 and the report will be finalised and will be made available in the first half of 2018.

The Tackling Indigenous Smoking (TIS) Program funds activities which aim to prevent the uptake of smoking and support smoking cessation among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The program aims to contribute to closing the gap in Indigenous health outcomes by reducing tobacco smoking as the most significant risk factor for chronic disease among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.  

The TIS Program has a budget allocation of $AUD116.8 million for the three years 2015-16 to 2017-18.  Funding of up to $AUD183.7 million has been approved for four years from 2018-19 to 2021-22.

The Tackling Indigenous Smoking Program currently (from 2015-16 to 2017-18) comprises:

•	37 targeted regional tobacco control grants for (predominantly) Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (ACCHS) to reach out to Indigenous communities to increase awareness of the harms from smoking and design and implement smoking prevention and cessation activities tailored to local needs;
•	a National Best Practice Unit (NBPU) to support the regional tobacco control grant recipients (provides tailored, one-on-one support from project planning through to implementation and evaluation, to feed back into delivery and outcome improvements);
•	seven innovation project research grants building the evidence base on how to better address the most difficult and critical Indigenous smoking behaviours (such as very high rates of smoking in remote areas and among pregnant women);
•	a National Coordinator to provide high-level advice and insight to assist in the shaping of policy and the approach for the TIS program, and practical leadership and advocacy in the national implementation of the program, having regard for traditional culture and values;
•	the Quitskills accredited training package delivered by Cancer Council South Australia (CCSA) which provides brief intervention and motivational training in best-practice intervention methods. Quitskills funding aims to increase the number of suitably trained and qualified professionals working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smokers and their communities;
•	Indigenous Quitline enhancement grants to the State and Territory run Quitlines to improve their capacity to provide accessible and appropriate services to Indigenous people, including enhancements for young people, pregnant women and new mothers. The funds support employment of Indigenous staff, as well as training and resources for all Quitline staff; and 
•	a program evaluation component implemented by an external evaluator; the evaluation is being used to assess the program’s appropriateness, effectiveness, impact, and efficiency, and to inform best practice learning and continuous program improvement.","Education, communication, training and public awareness are a joint responsibility of the Commonwealth Government and state and territory governments.

De acuerdo con los requisitos de la Ley de control de tabaco, existe una serie de proyectos de comunicación implementados por varios organismos gubernamentales y no gubernamentales para promover la vida libre de tabaco y el abandono del tabaco.  Los programas de comunicación se han dirigido principalmente a los jóvenes, a fin de movilizarlos en favor de los Estilos de Vida Saludables. A partir de 2004, la publicidad sobre los efectos nocivos del consumo de tabaco se emite en televisión y radio nacionales durante 3 a 5 meses al año. De hecho, estas campañas se han realizado en el marco de la celebración anual del Día Mundial Sin Tabaco, donde también se llevan a cabo campañas de sensibilización. 
	
Puntualmente, y en el marco de los convenios desarrollados con entidades nacionales e internacionales, se han desarrollado diversas estrategias de información, educación y comunicación que han tenido como objetivo la socialización de las medidas de control de tabaco y los riesgos del consumo y la exposición al humo de tabaco. Las piezas comunicativas han estado dirigidas principalmente a la población joven con el objeto de movilizarlos a favor de la cultura de la salud. De igual forma, los territorios han desarrollado diversas iniciativas de comunicación para informar a la población general sobre las graves consecuencias del tabaquismo, en términos individuales y colectivos. Estas campañas han estado dirigidas a población general y población joven.

Vale destacar, además, que en el Día Mundial Sin Tabaco del año 2011, el Ministerio de Salud junto con el Instituto Nacional de Cancerología han liderado la campaña ""Parques y Playas libres de humo"", cuyo propósito es el de concientizar al público (particularmente el público joven) sobre los beneficios de no fumar, y la necesidad de proteger a las personas y al planeta de las consecuencias del consumo y exposición al humo de tabaco.  Ver: https://www.minsalud.gov.co/Paginas/Playas-y-parques-libres-de-humo.aspx 

Para el año 2012 se creó una estrategia de comunicación para jóvenes llamada “Generación más somos más sin tabaco”, la cual está dirigida a jóvenes y la cual busca mostrar lo positivo de no fumar. Para esta campaña se diseñaron una serie de materiales comunicativos entre los que se encuentran un comercial de tv, afiches manillas. Así mismo, se diseñó una plataforma virtual llamada generación más en la cual se desarrollan diferentes actividades relacionadas con promoción y prevención de los cuatro factores protectores entre los cuales está el no consumo de tabaco. Ver: https://www.minsalud.gov.co/Paginas/Somos%20m%C3%A1s%20sin%20tabaco.aspx

En 2014, se desarrolló la estrategia “No fumo no quiero, porque me quiero”, dirigida a mujeres jóvenes. Ver: http://www.generacionmas.gov.co/VidaSana/pages/Somos-mas-sin-tabaco.aspx

Paralelamente, el Instituto Nacional de Cancerología ha desarrollado la estrategia de comunicación “No Fumar es la Actitud”, que cuenta con un amplio número de seguidores en las redes sociales. En el marco de esta estrategia, se han diseñado y distribuido 12000 postales a la ciudadanía en distintos puntos de la capital colombiana. Esta es una pieza que se utiliza también en las charlas y presentaciones que hace el Instituto Nacional de Cancerología del tema. Así mismo, se han diseñado aplicaciones para dispositivos móviles interactivas para padres e hijos.

Respecto al entorno educativo, se han implementado diversas estrategias. De un lado se ha implementado la Ruta pedagógica para la práctica de estilos de vida saludable. En esta Ruta, se priorizaron instituciones educativas en área rural, vulnerable y dispersa y se capacita la comunidad educativa con el fin de promover hábitos (actividad física, alimentación saludable, no consumo de tabaco y alcohol). Esta iniciativa está en 15 departamentos del país. La implementación de la Ruta Pedagógica para la Promoción de Estilos de Vida Saludable se desarrolla en los territorios con sus comunidades, partiendo de un momento que tiene  como objetivo la construcción colectiva de iniciativas a cargo de la comunidad educativa y que respondan al contexto y realidad local, y de una fase de seguimiento, que busca consolidar las mismas, a través de la generación de nuevos conocimientos y el intercambio de experiencias.

Esta articulación de estrategias ha dejado dentro de sus principales logros, la implementación de una nueva iniciativa denominada Semilleros juveniles para la Promoción de Estilos de Vida Saludable (actividad física, alimentación saludable, no consumo de tabaco y alcohol), es una estrategia que busca favorecer la “formación e inclusión de adolescentes y jóvenes no escolarizados y a estudiantes de educación media en el territorio”, para que desempeñen en sus comunidades y entornos cotidianos, el rol de animadores culturales y dinamizadores de los estilos de vida saludable, a través del arte, la cultura, la comunicación y el deporte. 

Los Semilleros Juveniles, tienen como principal objetivo brindar formación en promoción de la salud a adolescentes y jóvenes, a partir de la comunicación alternativa y cultural como mecanismo para lograr transformar los imaginarios colectivos y socioculturales de sus comunidades, en temas relacionados con la salud y las buenas prácticas para una vida saludable, así como el empoderamiento territorial para la gestión de estrategias para el desarrollo y la sostenibilidad de la salud. 

De otro modo, desde el Ministerio de Educación Nacional, en cumplimiento con la “Política Nacional de Reducción de la Demanda de Drogas” y con el “Plan Nacional de Promoción de la Salud, la prevención y la atención del consumo de sustancias psicoactivas (PNPSPACSPA) 2014-2021”, viene trabajando articuladamente en el marco de la Comisión Nacional de Reducción de la Demanda de Drogas y de la Comisión Técnica Nacional. En estas comisiones participan los sectores de salud, justicia, protección, seguridad y educación.

En el componente de prevención del Plan Nacional se han venido definiendo distintas acciones a desarrollar para el 2017-2018. El MEN y las demás instituciones miembros de la Comisión técnica realizan las siguientes acciones para impactar a las escuelas: a) 
Construcción de un módulo de formación dirigido a docentes de preescolar, básica y media en prevención del consumo de sustancias psicoactivas en el marco del Modelo de formación y acompañamiento de educación para la ciudadanía; b) Diseño de secuencias didácticas en gestión del riesgo, la ética y el cuidado de los estudiantes

En convenio con la Organización Internacional para las Migraciones (OIM), se contrató a un consultor para el diseño del módulo de formación y las secuencias didácticas. Se ha avanzado en un documento borrador del módulo y de las secuencias didácticas para la prevención del consumo de sustancias psicoactivas, lo incluye tabaco. 

Paralelamente, existe un Convenio entre la Policía Nacional y el Ministerio de Educación Nacional, cuyo objeto es “aunar esfuerzos técnicos y administrativos para el fortalecimiento del sistema nacional de convivencia escolar en las entidades territoriales e instituciones educativas focalizadas, relacionadas con la prevención del consumo de sustancias psicoactivas y la promoción de estilos de vida saludables”.

En el marco de este Convenio se han revisado los documentos del Programa Escolarizado de Prevención del Consumo de Drogas, y se ha apoyado la reingeniería del Programa Escolarizado con el apoyo del Embajada de los Estados Unidos, la Universidad de los Andes y la Universidad de Nueva York. También se ha brindado capacitación a alrededor de cien instructores de la Dirección de Antinarcóticos en convivencia escolar y promoción de estilos de vida saludables como factores protectores frente al consumo de SPA.

Se está avanzado en el diseño de un Protocolo para la activación de la atención de casos de consumo de sustancias psicoactivas en el entorno educativo, inicialmente a través de una revisión de las experiencias regionales y locales sobre la materia. Se están revisando las experiencias de Bogotá y Cali a nivel nacional y a nivel regional de Perú, Ecuador, Chile, Argentina, México entre otras. Adicionalmente, este protocolo se armonizará con las Ruta de Atención Integral establecidas por el Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social.  

Por otro lado, se han venido realizando reuniones con la policía nacional para estudiar los mecanismos jurídicos y técnicos necesarios en la construcción de un Protocolo de llegada de la Policía a los establecimientos educativos. Se ha avanzado en la redacción de un documento borrador preliminar que fue revisado internamente en el MEN y actualmente se encuentra en proceso de revisión y envío de observaciones por parte de los integrantes del Comité Nacional de Convivencia Escolar. 

Por último, desde el 2016, el Ministerio de Educación junto con el Ministerio de Salud y Protección Social y el Ministerio de Justicia y del Derecho, participaron en el diseño de la Encuesta de Consumo de Sustancias Psicoactivas en población escolar - Colombia 2016. El Centro Nacional de Consultoría fue el encargado de desarrollar el operativo de campo. El análisis de la información lo llevó a cabo la Comisión Interamericana para el Control del Abuso de Drogas (CICAD) y ya se cuentan con los resultados y se espera presentar dichos resultados en el primer semestre de 2018.","Los artículos 7, 8, 9, 10 y 11 de la Ley 1335 de 2009 contemplan el desarrollo de programas, políticas y estrategias de educación, comunicación y concientización del público acerca de los riesgos de consumir productos de tabaco.

Puntualmente, y en el marco de los convenios desarrollados con entidades nacionales e internacionales, se han desarrollado diversas estrategias de información, educación y comunicación que han tenido como objetivo la socialización de las medidas de control de tabaco y los riesgos del consumo y la exposición al humo de tabaco. Las piezas comunicativas han estado dirigidas principalmente a la población joven con el objeto de movilizarlos a favor de la cultura de la salud.

De igual forma, los territorios han desarrollado diversas iniciativas de comunicación para informar a la población general sobre las graves consecuencias del tabaquismo, en términos individuales y colectivos. Estas campañas han estado dirigidas a población general y población joven.

Vale destacar, además, que en el Día Mundial Sin Tabaco del año 2011, el Ministerio de Salud junto con el Instituto Nacional de Cancerología han liderado la campaña ""Parques y Playas libres de humo"", cuyo propósito es el de concientizar al público (particularmente el público joven) sobre los beneficios de no fumar, y la necesidad de proteger a las personas y al planeta de las consecuencias del consumo y exposición al humo de tabaco.

Para el año 2012 se creó una estrategia de comunicación para jóvenes llamada “Generación más somos más sin tabaco”, la cual está dirigida a jóvenes y la cual busca mostrar lo positivo de no fumar. Para esta campaña se diseñaron una serie de materiales comunicativos entre los que se encuentran un comercial de tv, afiches manillas. Así mismo, se diseñó una plataforma virtual llamada generación más en la cual se desarrollan diferentes actividades relacionadas con promoción y prevención de los cuatro factores protectores entre los cuales está el no consumo de tabaco.

Paralelamente, el Instituto Nacional de Cancerología ha desarrollado la estrategia de comunicación “ No Fumar es la Actitud”, que cuenta con un amplio número de seguidores en las redes sociales 

  

En el marco de esta estrategia, se han diseñado y distribuido 12000 postales a la ciudadanía en distintos puntos de la capital colombiana. Esta es una pieza que se utiliza también en las charlas y presentaciones que hace el Instituto Nacional de Cancerología del tema.

 

Así mismo, se han diseñado aplicaciones para dispositivos móviles interactivas para padres e hijos.

  

De otro modo, desde el Ministerio de Educación Nacional, se viene implementando el Programa de Promoción de Estilos de Vida Saludables (PPEVS) desde el año 2009, que en su inició se enfocó hacia la prevención de Sustancias Psicoactivas (SPA) y que posteriormente amplía su marco de acción hacia temáticas relacionadas con la alimentación saludable y balanceada, el fomento de la actividad física, uso del tiempo libre, manejo de las emociones y desarrollo de una sexualidad sana y responsable. 

El programa ofrece a las entidades territoriales orientaciones conceptuales, pedagógicas y operativas para guiar a los establecimientos educativos en la construcción de proyectos pedagógicos para la promoción de los estilos de vida saludables. Con estos proyectos pedagógicos, se pretende generar competencias ciudadanas para que los y las estudiantes puedan construir un bienestar propio y colectivo, cuidando la salud y el entorno para que puedan desarrollarse plenamente como ciudadanos y ciudadanas respetuosos/as de lo público dentro de su contexto de vida cotidiana.","En el marco de los convenios desarrollados con entidades nacionales e internacionales. se han desarrollado diversas estrategias de información. educación y comunicación que han tenido como objetivo la socialización de las medidas de control de tabaco y los riesgos del consumo y la exposición al humo de tabaco.

Desde la Dirección de Promoción de la Salud del Ministerio de Salud se ha venido llevando a cabo el proyecto ""Ponele a la Vida"" desde hace más de cuatro años, en varios colegios del país, con el objetivo de promover los estilos de vida saludables en los adolescentes, dirigido hacia una mejor alimentación, practicar actividad física y adoptar una vida libre de tabaco.

Desde el 2017, también, la Dirección de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico en Salud del Ministerio de Salud inició el proyecto llamado Unidades Itinerantes para la Prevención contra el Consumo de Tabaco, focalizado en niños de escuelas, cuya primer etapa incluyó las del área rural del sur del país. Consiste en dos contenedores que visitan las escuelas y están equipados con información y dispositivos electrónicos, en donde los niños aprenden sobre los peligros del consumo de tabaco y los beneficios de vivir alejados de este producto. 

El Programa de Control de Tabaco y la Dirección de Desarrollo Científico y Tecnológico en Salud del Ministerio de Salud aún se encuentra perfilando un convenio de cooperación con el Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnología, con el fin de que el primero le traslade anualmente ₡100 millones al segundo para el financiamiento de investigaciones relacionadas al tabaquismo y control de tabaco.

La Dirección de Vigilancia de la Salud desarrolló por tercer año consecutivo el proyecto ""Domingos Familiares sin Humo"", en conjunto con la Municipalidad de San José, espacio en el cual se utiliza la vía pública por cerca de 7 domingos seguidos durante el verano para convertirlo en un campo de recreación, con diversas actividades, entre las cuales se cuentan de promoción de la salud, enfocadas a la prevención del consumo de tabaco. En 2017, por primera vez, el proyecto se llevó a las otras provincias del país en coordinación con las municipalidades de dichos lugares.

A finales del 2016, el Programa de Control de Tabaco aprovechó el espacio en el Festival de la Luz, pasacalles que se organiza en la capital a mediados de diciembre -y cuya exposición mediática es de las más altas del año por parte de los principales medios de comunicación del país-, para llevar una carroza con un mensaje antitabaco y de promoción de una vida libre de tabaquismo.

Por su parte, la Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social tiene una lucha frontal contra el fumado en dos áreas, la primera en la parte atencional, con las clínicas de cesación y el segundo frente es evitar que la gente empiece a fumar especialmente las personas jóvenes, para ello se ha dado a la tarea de buscar estrategias para poder llegarle diferente a la gente, no solo estamos usando las redes sociales, sino que se le está diciendo a la gente que nos ayude a luchar contra el tabaco.

La CCSS, además, ha estado desarrollando el proyecto “Compromiso contra el Fumado”, que inició en el 2014 y está enfocado en la prevención del consumo en niños, primordialmente, de segundo ciclo, a través de actividades curriculares y extracurriculares, como concursos de arte, de oratoria, festivales deportivos, ferias científicas las cuales son acompañadas por personeros de las áreas de salud. 

Por su parte, el IAFA cuenta con programas de promoción dentro de los cuales se destaca ""Deje y gane"", concurso que se ha venido implementando cada dos años desde el 2000, y consiste en que las personas fumadoras se inscriban por medio de una boleta  física, de manera digital o por llamada telefónica, para que asuman el reto de dejar de fumar durante un mes. Después de ese período se realiza un sorteo en el que se seleccionan al menos 15 personas participantes a las que se les realiza un examen de marcadores de nicotina para comprobar el proceso de cesación, esto en colaboración con el hospital privado Clínica Bíblica. Si el examen resulta positivo la persona pierde el derecho a ganar el premio dispuesto, pero si el examen nicotínico es negativo la persona puede reclamar el premio correspondiente. 

Otro de los programas de promoción de la salud es “El Club de los Vencedores”, el cual consiste en un grupo de acompañamiento de personas que han dejado el consumo de tabaco o que se encuentran en proceso, al que el IAFA les brinda asesoría para lograr el objetivo de no volver a consumir. Destaca la creación de una aplicación para teléfonos inteligentes que se descarga de manera gratuita llamada “Entrenador Anti-fumado”, la cual busca que las personas que intentan disminuir y terminar su consumo puedan crearse un plan de cesación que se va actualizando, mostrando los logros en salud y económicos conforme se va dejando de consumir.

Del lado de la educación formal, el programa ""Aprendo a valerme por mi mismo"", que en el 2016 cumplió 10 años de realizarse en escuelas. Este busca promover la enseñanza y práctica de las habilidades para vivir en la población de preescolar y escolar, como estrategia para prevenir y rechazar el consumo de drogas. El objetivo es fortalecer los factores de protección y reducir los factores de riesgo para prevenir y desestimular el consumo de tabaco, alcohol y otras drogas.

A nivel de empresas aún se continúa ejecutando “Espacios Libres de Humo de Tabaco”, programa de sensibilización y capacitación que se imparte en centros de trabajo para trabajadores, colaborando para que los profesionales de salud que laboran en estos conformen grupos de apoyo o refieran a las clínicas de cesación a la población fumadora.
 
De parte del ICODER que también recibe dinero de la Ley 9028, presentó en el 2017 el proyecto “El deporte como 	acción preventiva contra el consumo de tabaco”, que tuvo el objetivo de promover el deporte de alto rendimiento como impulso al desarrollo de estilos de vida activos y saludables por medio de programas y proyectos internacionales, nacionales y locales. Para ello, se tenía proyectado capacitar a las entidades deportivas sobre la ley, dotar de becas deportivas a atletas y la utilización de logos y signos externos en contra del consumo del tabaco. 

El CEN-CINAI, ente que se encuentra adscrito al Ministerio de Salud, y se encarga de velar por el estado nutricional de la población materno/infantil, desarrolló el proyecto de fomento a la autoestima y autonomía de los niños, en donde se les enseñaba a mantenerse alejados de las drogas como el tabaco.

De igual forma, el Ministerio de Educación Pública, en conjunto con el Ministerio de Salud y el Instituto Costarricense sobre Drogas, desarrollan proyectos similares en escuelas y colegios.","El Ministerio de Salud a través del desarrollo de Proyectos en los 3 niveles de Gestión ha emprendido acciones de información y educación a la población con el fin de controlar y detener las consecuencias negativas e incluso adictivas del consumo de tabaco, por cuanto este produce morbilidad, mortalidad y discapacidad.

etc.","Ministry of Education Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic financially supports the prevention programs in which smoking prevention is one of the priorities. The programs are aimed at work with pupils teachers and teacher´s education in this field.
All schools have a “prevention methodologist” who is responsible for the smoking prevention activities.
A national system of quality assessment of preventive programs for schools (called a certification procedure) is in place - prevention of tobacco use is a required part of these programs. This system has a practical impact on the above mentioned grant system of the Ministry of Education Youth and Sport of the Czech Republic.
A proposal of a general basic framework for preventive activities in the context of elementary schools (so-called the Basic Preventive Program) was introduced in 2012. 
- BPP comprises among others a component of programs specifically aimed at addressing of individual forms of risk behaviour including tobacco use.

Healthcare Institutions

Healthcare professionals are equipped with the skills and knowledge to provide opportunistic smoking cessation advice to patients through a structured smoking cessation training programme, known as the Certification for Quit Smoking Consultants (CQSC). 

HPB works in collaboration with restructured hospitals (owned by the Government and receives a government subsidy, but is run as a private company) to fund their inpatient smoking cessation programme. As smoking could aggravate or induce many health conditions, the inpatient smoking cessation program aims to nudge smokers kick start their quitting journey during their stay in the hospital.  

Smoking cessation counselling is also available at more than 150 healthcare touch points island-wide, which include retail pharmacies and primary care institutions. 

Workplaces

HPB works with workplaces to develop customized workplace smoking control programmes that aim to help employees who smoke quit the habit to achieve better health, finances and productivity at work. 
These programmes fall into three broad categories: awareness, cessation, and sustenance. For awareness, HPB conducts motivational talks that encourage smokers to contemplate quitting and non-smokers to continue maintaining a smoke-free lifestyle. HPB also distributes support resources such as posters and pamphlets to workplaces. These help to de-stigmatize smoking and foster a supportive work environment for smokers to quit. For cessation, HPB conducts group counselling sessions for smokers in their workplaces over a period of 6 weeks. Smokers are also encouraged to sign up for the I Quit 28-day countdown challenge to complement their participation in the workplace programme. For sustenance, HPB provides smoking cessation counselling training for interested staff so that they are equipped to provide opportunistic counselling advice to their smoker colleagues.   

HPB also works with the Uniformed Services, including both recruits and management personnel, to develop and implement smoking cessation programmes specifically tailored to their needs and setting. This includes holistic health seminars where smoking is introduced as a negative coping mechanism, group cessation programmes with interactive activities, as well as capacity building workshops for interested personnel. Since 2014, HPB has been working with the Singapore Armed Forces to expand the suite of smoking control programmes to more units.

Youth Programmes

Education and awareness, with appropriate interventions, are critical in preventing tobacco use and initiation among youths. HPB works closely with the Ministry of Education (MOE) and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to incorporate anti-tobacco messages into the curriculum and co-curricular activities. These initiatives aim to raise awareness about the benefits of leading a tobacco-free lifestyle, dispel common misconceptions about smoking, and equip youth with life skills to refuse cigarette offers.

HPB also adopts a targeted approach by offering smoking cessation interventions to youth smokers in schools and community organisations.  These cessation programmes for youth are underpinned by a strengths-based approach that seeks to harness positive aspects of the youth to bring about behaviour change. This approach is based on the understanding that youth will be more ready to address their problems when they feel empowered and more confident about their own abilities. 

HPB’s cessation programme helps youth channel their attention away from smoking and other risky behaviours by engaging in healthy activities aligned with their strengths. It also equips youth with the knowledge and skills to kick the habit and learn coping strategies to better deal with stress, anger, frustration or boredom. 

Student Health Advisors (SHAs) provide tailored smoking cessation counselling to youth smokers in schools. Counselling sessions are conducted on an individual and/or group basis, depending on the youth’s specific needs and preferences.

HPB complements the school-based smoking cessation efforts with a youth-targeted web-based smoking cessation programme, www.breakfree.sg, which helps youth to understand the harms of smoking and equips them with coping strategies to deal with withdrawal symptoms and quit the habit for good. Counselling support is also provided via HPB’s Quitline (Tel: 1800 438 2000) services.

Community 

Besides preventing smoking initiation among youth, HPB also focuses on smoking cessation to encourage quitting among the general population. To this end, HPB launched the I Quit Movement in June 2011 to inspire smokers to quit with the use of inspiring testimonials and role models coupled with a strong support network which smokers can tap on.  

As part of its 2013 I Quit campaign, HPB introduced the Let’s Quit: The 28-Day Countdown. The 28-Day Countdown is based on findings that smokers who stay smoke-free for 28 days are five times more likely to succeed for good.  The 28-Day Countdown helps smokers quit smoking by breaking down the quit journey into daily, small actionable steps, and equip them with the knowledge and support to remain smoke-free through the crucial period of 28 days. 
Since 2014, the programme has reached out to approximately 10,000 smokers per year and that 10% of the participants stayed smoke-free for 28 days.

In 2018, HPB will continue to reach out to smokers via roadshows at community and workplace settings.  HPB will also expand its outreach and support network","Identifying, developing and sustaining partnerships is key to the implementation and effectiveness of programmes.

Student Health Advisors (SHAs) provide tailored smoking cessation counselling to youth smokers in schools. Counselling sessions are conducted on an individual and/or group basis, depending on the youth’s specific needs and preferences.

HPB complements the school-based smoking cessation efforts with a youth-targeted web-based smoking cessation programme, www.breakfree.sg, which helps youth to understand the harms of smoking and equips them with coping strategies to deal with withdrawal symptoms and quit the habit for good. Counselling support is also provided via HPB’s Quitline (Tel: 1800 438 2000) services.

Community 

Besides preventing smoking initiation among youth, HPB also focuses on smoking cessation to encourage quitting among the general population. To this end, HPB launched the I Quit Movement in June 2011 to inspire smokers to quit with the use of inspiring testimonials and role models coupled with a strong support network which smokers can tap on.  

As part of its 2013 I Quit campaign, HPB introduced the Let’s Quit: The 28-Day Countdown. The 28-Day Countdown is based on findings that smokers who stay smoke-free for 28 days are five times more likely to succeed for good.  The 28-Day Countdown helps smokers quit smoking by breaking down the quit journey into daily, small actionable steps, and equip them with the knowledge and support to remain smoke-free through the crucial period of 28 days. 
Over 12,000 smokers signed up for the challenge from June 2013 to December 2015. Preliminary data show that 10% of the participants stayed smoke-free for 28 days.

Recognizing that smokers are also more likely to quit successfully when they are in a supportive environment, HPB has also engaged non-smokers in a more active role through the #StepUpForAQuitter campaign in 2015. As part of this campaign, smokers and non-smokers paired up to document their daily experiences during their 28-day quit journey.","Identifying developing and sustaining partnerships is key to the implementation and effectiveness of programmes. The Health Promotion Board actively engages educational institutions private workplaces the uniformed services health professionals youth organisations community and religious groups and parents to promote a smoke-free lifestyle. Partnership is often in the form of capacity building and consultative service to improve knowledge and skills pertaining to tobacco control as well as providing assistance in the organisation of implementing appropriate tobacco control programmes for various target audiences. 
Health Professionals
HPB partners with health professionals in many aspects of tobacco control and smoking cessation. Through a structured smoking cessation training programme called Certification for Quit Smoking Consultants (CQSC) developed by HPB doctors nurses dentists pharmacists and other allied health professionals are equipped with the skills and knowledge to provide opportunistic smoking cessation advice to patients. Basic smoking cessation training around motivational interviewing is also provided for medical dental pharmacy and allied health students at institutes of higher learning.
 
HPB works in collaboration with Singapore''s restructured hospitals (owned by the Government but run as a private company and receiving a government subsidy) in funding inpatient and outpatient smoking cessation programmes to aid smokers to quit. Smoking cessation services are also available at more than 150 healthcare touchpoints in the community such as at retail pharmacies and primary healthcare settings. 
Workplaces
The workplace is a natural opportunistic setting to reach smokers since two out of every three Singaporeans work. Thus HPB partners workplaces to provide a supportive social environment conducive for quitting smoking through the development of smoke-free policies and initiatives. This includes implementing a structured 3-month Workplace Smoking Control Programme (WSCP) that aims to help employees who smoke quit the habit successfully to achieve better health finances and productivity at work.
HPB also works with the uniformed services such as the police and armed forces to develop and implement smoking cessation programmes specifically tailored to their needs and setting. This includes programmes to provide smoking cessation mentors access to smoking cessation services and capacity building.
Youth Programmes
Recognising that the long-term health effects of smoking do not always resonate with young people HPB launched the “Live it up without lighting up” (LIUWLU) initiative in 2009 targeted youth aged 13 – 23 years. The initiative highlights the benefits of being tobacco-free focussing on 4 areas that resonate with youth namely appearance fitness spending power and the environment. Several programmes and activities have been rolled out under LIUWLU.

Since the last report submission this measures unfortunately have included only alcohol and not tobacco. 
One measure during the strategy period is aimed at school personnel. Research has shown that schools in Sweden find it difficult to implement a tobacco-free school playground and tobacco-free school hours. The Swedish National Agency for Education has arranged different educational efforts for principals and other school personnel during 2012 to 2014. The Agency has also produced material to support teachers in their teaching concerning these matters.
In 2011 the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (NBHW) published national guidelines for methods of preventing disease. to support governance and management of health care.

Public Health Campaigns 
January Health harms: In 2013 the Department of Health launched a “health harms” campaign to encourage smokers to quit in the New Year. The campaign aims to increase awareness by highlighting the immediate damage being done by every single cigarette. Smokers will be encouraged to collect a free Quit Kit from their local participating pharmacy to help support their quit attempt. The Health Harms campaign has run each year since 2013. The campaign which included televised adverts key plank of our was to return to health harms advertising.  We launched this with our first campaign in support of this strategy – ‘mutation’ – which showed a tumour developing on a cigarette, with the line ‘If you could see the damage, you wouldn’t smoke’.

Stoptober: The Government continues to run Stoptober, a 28 day mass participation event to help smokers in the UK quit via a public challenge to stop smoking for the duration of the month of October.  The 2014 campaign had over 250,000 participants and was concurrently run in New Zealand and the Netherlands. Social media plays an integral part in this campaign, designed using behavioral economic principles. Participants were supported to quit, receiving a free Stoptober pack with information about the health and financial benefits of quitting smoking. 

Smokefree homes and cars campaign:   The Smokefree Homes and Cars campaign was first run in 2012, and then again in summery 2013.  The campaign achieved the highest campaign awareness since 2005 and successfully changed both attitudes and behaviours around smoking in the home and car, as well as triggering significant numbers of quit attempts.  Smokefree Kits further boosted people’s chances of quitting successfully.
