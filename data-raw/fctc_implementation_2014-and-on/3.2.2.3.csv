"35","Colombia","La protección de los espacios libres de humo de tabaco y sus derivados se encuentra establecida en la Ley 1335 de 2009. Esta Ley es de carácter nacional, obedeciendo a la organización centralizada del Estado colombiano, por lo tanto es de obligatorio cumplimiento en todo el territorio nacional. Esta Ley, además, establece disposiciones para la prevención de los daños a la salud de los menores de edad, la población no fumadora y se estipulan políticas públicas para la prevención del consumo del tabaco y el abandono de la dependencia del tabaco del fumador y sus derivados en la población colombiana.   

El Capítulo V (Artículos 18 a 21) de la Ley 1335 de 2009 consagra los derechos de los ciudadanos de Colombia a contar con ambientes libres de humo de tabaco. 

El Artículo 18 de la citada ley establece los derechos de los no fumadores, a saber: 

–	Respirar aire que esté libre de humo de tabaco. 
–	Protestar cuando los productos del tabaco están encendidos en lugares donde está prohibido su uso por la ley y la exigencia de que el propietario, representante legal, gerente, administrador o responsable con cualquier título relativo a la empresa o establecimiento, advierta a aquellos que usan productos de tabaco a dejar de usarlos. 
–	Comparecer ante la autoridad competente en defensa de sus derechos como no fumadores y exigir su protección. 
–	Demandar la publicidad masiva sobre los efectos nocivos y mortales causadas por el tabaco y la exposición al humo de tabaco. 
–	Informar de incumplimiento de las disposiciones de la ley a la autoridad competente. 
El Artículo 19 de la ley enumera los lugares públicos donde el consumo de productos de tabaco no se permite. Estos incluyen: 

–	Lugares de trabajo cerrados y/o lugares públicos, tales como: bares, restaurantes, centros comerciales, tiendas, ferias, festivales, parques, estadios, cafeterías, salones de baile, cibercafés, hoteles, ferias [sic], pubs, casinos, zonas comunes y las salas de espera donde se llevan a cabo eventos masivos, entre otros. 
–	Todos los establecimientos de salud. 
–	Instituciones de educación formal e informal en todos los niveles. 
–	Establecimientos que donde se atiendan menores de edad. 
–	Espacios deportivos y culturales, como museos y bibliotecas. 
–	Medios de transporte públicos (incluida la oficial, la escolar, la mixta y el servicio privado). 
–	Entidades públicas y privadas dirigidas a cualquier tipo de actividad industrial, comercial o de servicios, incluidas sus áreas de servicio al cliente y salas de espera.
–	Áreas donde el consumo de productos de tabaco puede constituir un riesgo alto de combustión, debido a la presencia de materiales inflamables, tales como estaciones de gasolina, sitios de almacenamiento para combustibles o materiales explosivos y similares.  

Es importante señalar que el precitado Artículo 19, al no establecer condición alguna para extender la protección de los ambientes 100% libres de humo de tabaco a un área determinada de los lugares allí enunciados, permite concluir que la protección es completa; así, tanto en las áreas cerradas como en las áreas abiertas de estos lugares no está permitido el consumo de este tipo de productos.

Dicha interpretación del texto legal, resulta de la utilización del principio de proporcionalidad de esta medida de salud pública. Esto implica que la posibilidad de permitir que en dichas áreas abiertas se pudiese consumir esta clase de productos y de esta forma, exponer a los no fumadores y en general a toda la población al humo de segunda mano, queda descartada ante el potencial daño que esto acarrearía en la salud de las personas y ante el deber del gobierno nacional frente a garantizar medidas efectivas para la protección del derecho a la salud. 

Por su parte, el artículo 21 de la ley establece las definiciones de “área cerrada”, “humo de segunda mano del tabaco o humo de tabaco ambiental”, “fumar”, “lugar de trabajo”, “lugares públicos”, “transporte público”. Estas definiciones corresponden a las previstas en el CMCT de la OMS y las Directrices para la aplicación del Artículo 8. 

Vale mencionar, que en la Ley 769 de 2002, por medio de la cual se expide el Código Nacional de Tránsito Terrestre se prohíbe fumar en los vehículos automotores:

“Artículo 132. Fumador. El pasajero que sea sorprendido fumando en un vehículo de servicio público, será obligado a abandonar el automotor y deberá asistir a un curso de seguridad vial. Si se tratare del conductor, éste también deberá asistir a un curso de seguridad vial.

Parágrafo. El conductor de servicio público de transporte de pasajeros que sea sorprendido fumando mientras conduce se hará acreedor a una sanción de diez (10) salarios mínimos legales diarios vigentes”.
