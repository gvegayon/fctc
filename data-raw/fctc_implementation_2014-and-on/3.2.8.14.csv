The brief intervention is mostly offered by physicians and increasingly also by nurses. There are specialised courses in place on prevention of harmful use of addictive substances and treatment of addictions is obligatory for all physicians of all branches as a part of specialization trainings (as was aforementioned). The Society for Treatment of Tobacco Dependence (www.SLZT.CZ) provides continuing education in treatment of tobacco dependence for physicians (CME credits of the Czech medical Chamber, one-day courses), nurses (CME credits of the Czech Association of Nurses, one-day course) and pharmacists (CME credits of the Pharmacist’s Chamber, 2-day course). It provides also education and regular update for nurses and physicians of Centres for Tobacco-Dependent, including regular conferences at least twice a year. There is a collaboration of nurses from the General University Hospital in Prague and the Society for Treatment of Tobacco Dependence with International Society of Nurses in Cancer Care (www.isncc.org) which is focused on educating nurses in brief interventions. Most of health professions undergo occasional trainings in treatment of tobacco dependence, but it is not systematic. Trainings include treatment of pregnant, psychiatric, adolescent and other disadvantaged smokers, as well.

Tobacco Guidelines for treatment of tobacco dependence (from 2015) are used. (Available on-line: http://www.vnitrnilekarstvi.eu/vnitrni-lekarstvi-clanek/doporuceni-pro-lecbu-zavislosti-na-tabaku-52291). New guidelines for psychiatric care, including a chapter about tobacco dependence treatment for psychiatric patients, are ready to be published in 2018.
Intensive treatment is offered within the Centres for Tobacco-Dependent, based in hospitals mostly at pneumology, cardiology, internal clinics - currently 41 Centres across the country (see http://www.slzt.cz/centra-lecby). They are under supervision of the Society for Treatment of Tobacco Dependence.
Treatment is also provided by some physicians, pneumologists and other medical specialists. It is not systematic. Treatment can be provided also by addictologists (a official branch of health professionals in the Czech Republic who focus on prevention and treatment of addictive diseases). Addictology services should supplement the existing network of Centres for Tobacco-Dependent in future and could focus on less motivated smokers, etc.
In terms of coverage of treatment by public funding, there are two treatment codes covered by the health insurance companies (60 minutes intervention, 30 minutes follow-up visit). From January 2017, these treatment codes for ambulant patients can be contracted by insurance companies also in some other types of health care facilities (not only in Centres for Treatment of Tobacco Dependence). Legislation adopted in 2013 allows to cover treatment provided by addictologists by health insurance. These agreements also include work with users of tobacco. The treatment service is free of charge apart from the medication for patients. Generally, the pharmacotherapy is not reimbursed by health insurance companies - only some of them financially support pharmacotherapy for their clients treated in the specialized Centres for Tobacco-Dependent and addictologic centres or in certified pharmacies.

Treatment of tobacco dependence is provided also in the Army of the Czech Republic (ACR), in particular on the basis of the Conception of primary prevention of risk behavior at personnel of the Ministry of Defence for the period of 2015 – 2019. It, inter alia, provides for preventive intervention as regards tobacco use.

Czech Pharmacists Chamber continued to organise program “Smoking Cessation in Pharmacies” in 2016 a 2017.

Phone number of the “Quit line” was changed in 2016 (the new number is 800 350 000) and from 2017,  the quitline is called “National”. The telephone number is provided by the Office of the Government of the Czech Republic (National Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Addiction), but operated by the NGO “Czech Coalition against Tobacco”.
It is available between 10 – 18 hours (more hours per day than in 2016) during working days. It is operated by the NGO “Czech Coalition against Tobacco” with financial support from the Office of the Government of the Czech Republic and of Ministry of Health (as regards promotion of the number).

National Public Health Institute:
In 2016 and 2017, projects ""Short Interventions in Practice I"" and ""Short Intervention in Practice II"" were implemented. The projects are implemented as a two-stage intervention with the education of health professionals / students at the first level who subsequently educate patients / clients of health care facilities. This is the ""training of trainers"" principle. Short intervention is aimed at reducing tobacco consumption as part of the portfolio of risk factors along with alcohol, nutrition and others.
The regional NIPH workplace in Jihlava is run by the Counseling Center for Smoking Cessation for the Vysocina Region.

Department of Addictology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and General University Hospital in Prague:  
Besides introducing tobacco cessation interventions into in-patient treatment programme, several studies were conducted in 2016 – 2017 on various populations. 
1)	Users of tobacco in GPs practice – evaluation of the impact of a “tobacco ban legislation” that was introduced in mid 2017. A pre-post assessment was conducted with ~140 patients. Results are to be published in specialty journals.
2)	Use of tobacco in the therapeutic communities – the study aimed at the assessment of views of the tobacco problem by treatment staff, mapping of what interventions they use in a day-to-day practice, etc. Results are to be published in specialty journals.
3)	A feasibility study of an eHealth intervention that is based on tobacco relapse management was conducted in 2016 and 2017 with very promising results. A wider implementation is expected in 2018-2019. Results will be published in a specialty journal.
4)	An update of an early detection and intervention aimed at Children and Adolescents as Patients in General Practice was conducted – declaring the importance of tobacco problem.

Several hospitals are active in the Health Promoting Hospitals/Smokefree Hospitals Program. 
As of 1 July 2017, a national network of non-smoking hospitals of the Czech Republic (official English translation: The National GNTH Network of the Czech Republic) was established at the Ministry of Health, which is now the main and official platform for the non-smoking hospital program in the Czech Republic.

This program associates healthcare facilities with the intent of combating smoking as the most important cause of mortality and morbidity in the population. Worldwide, the Global Network for Tobacco-Free Healthcare Services, which today consists of 24 sub-networks from 16 countries, covers the initiative.
The National GNTH Network of the Czech Republic has currently 5 members and Czech HPH (Health Promoting Hospitals) Network, which is focused on healthy lifestyle and also tobacco control in hospitals, consists of 11 members.

Further campaigns/projects:
There have not been any national specially designed programmes for specific social groups in the past two years. Campaigns/projects were rather generally focused.

While the EU provides the regulatory framework for the authorisation of medicinal products, the Member States decide about their accessibility e.g. the need for prescription, reimbursement status.
 
However, the EU supports Member States in their implementation of Article 14 of the FCTC. The Council Recommendation on smoke-free environments 2009/C 296/02 of 30 November 2009 calls on Member States to take effective measures to promote cessation of tobacco use and adequate treatment for tobacco dependence as outlined in Article 14 of the FCTC. 

The EU Health Programme provided funding to projects related to cessation of tobacco use. Cessation was also one of the three themes of the EU media campaign ""HELP - for a life without tobacco"" targeted at young people.

FILHA PROJECTS:
Influencing the development of the health care system regarding tobacco cessation support as part of the national health sector reform have been a priority for Finnish Lung Health Association (Filha) during 2016-2017. Filha has conducted nation-wide trainings of health professionals in tobacco dependence treatment best practices ever since the national Current Care guideline first was introduced in 2002.  During 2017 special emphasis has been put on developing tobacco cessation for mental health and substance abuse patients in a government funded project including 11/21 hospital districts in Finland. The work is executed by training health professionals, improving e.g. medical record documentation and referral practices as well as including peer support elements in the cessation support provided by health professionals. An internet-based tobacco cessation course for health professionals dealing with mental health and substance abuse patients has also been developed by Filha during 2017.

Filha started a project to develop cessation practices and tobacco dependence treatment for pregnant women in 2017. The work has started in maternal health care units in three municipalities in Finland and will result in a national recommendation and practical tool kit by the end of 2019.

Filha has developed a peer support-based tobacco cessation counselling model including group and individual face-to-face as well as internet-based counseling. The model has during 2016-2017 been developed especially taking into consideration population groups that on average use a lot of tobacco products such as mental health patients, unemployed, certain immigrant groups and vocational school students. 

Filha continues to work in collaboration with the Defense Forces of Finland influencing attitudes and practices regarding tobacco control by increasing general knowledge about tobacco related issues as well as cessation support. During 2016-2017 a guideline for tobacco-free Defence Forces was produced and nation-wide implementation of the guideline conducted. Through these actions a decrease in tobacco consumption for military conscripts and personnel of the Defense Forces is expected.","- Current care -cessation guidelines (2012) should be used by health care professionals.

El levantamiento de la información se llevó a cabo mediante un trabajo interinstitucional, con la participación de representantes de las principales instancias del Sistema Nacional de Salud Pública y organizaciones especializadas en tabaco de la sociedad civil (IMSS, ISSSTE, INCan, INER, HGM, CIJ, PEMEX, IPN, UNAM, SEDENA, FIC MÉXICO, ALIENTO, la clínica GRACIAS, NO FUMO, Aída Isibasi de Hodgers y CONADIC). 

El cuestionario fue validado por la OMS, y fue enviado a cada una de las instituciones para ser contestado. Los principales resultados señalaron que nuestro país cuenta con amplia infraestructura de servicios de salud para apoyar el abandono al consumo de tabaco, sin embargo, se vio necesario fortalecer el primer nivel de atención en salud a fin de coadyuvar en la referencia de los usuarios que consumen tabaco y requieren de un tratamiento o intervención.

Derivado de los resultados obtenidos en dicho diagnóstico, se identificó la necesidad de fortalecer el primer nivel de atención en salud. Para cubrir dicho objetivo, se desarrolló el estándar de competencias en proporcionar consejo breve para la cesación del consumo de alcohol y tabaco, el cual fue publicado el pasado 14 de julio de 2017 en el Diario Oficial de la Federación (DOF) (puede consultarse en: http://www.conocer.gob.mx/contenido/publicaciones_dof/2017/EC0897.pdf)

El estándar de competencias se trabajó de manera colegiada con expertos en consejo breve de diversas instituciones (ISSSTE, INER, FP-UNAM, INPRF, HGM, FM-UNAM, CONOCER e IMSS), el cual tiene como objetivo capacitar y evaluar al personal del primer nivel de atención en salud. 

A través de este estándar, se pretende que los médicos, psicólogos, enfermeras, odontólogos, educadores para la salud, entre otros, puedan otorgar un consejo breve a través de identificar en el consumo de alcohol y tabaco con un breve instrumento, posteriormente aconsejar a las personas que consuman alcohol y/o tabaco sobre las consecuencias del consumo, de las alternativas y ventajas de la cesación y de considerarlo conveniente proporcionar orientación y alternativas de atención al usuario de los servicios de salud que consume alcohol y/o tabaco. 

Con el objetivo de promover la homologación de los servicios de cesación del consumo de tabaco del Sistema Nacional de Salud y dar cumplimiento a lo dispuesto en la Norma Oficial Mexicana NOM-028-SSA2-2009, para la prevención, tratamiento y control de las adicciones se desarrollaron los Lineamientos para el Funcionamiento de los Servicios para la Cesación del Consumo de Tabaco, mismos que pretenden garantizar servicios de calidad para los usuarios que consumen tabaco. 

Los lineamientos fueron desarrollados por CONADIC, en coordinación con expertos en tratamiento para la cesación del consumo de tabaco, de los Centros de Integración Juvenil, A.C. (CIJ), del Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), del Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado (ISSSTE), de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Facultad de Medicina (UNAM-FM), del Hospital General de México “Dr. Eduardo Liceaga” (HGM), del Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias (INER), del Instituto Nacional de Cancerología (INCan), así como con representantes de la Sociedad Civil, de la Fundación Interamericana del Corazón, A. C., México (FIC-M) y de Alianza Nacional para el Control del Tabaco, A. C. 

Los lineamientos muestran las modalidades de atención que están validadas así como los requerimientos para brindar consejo breve, los requerimientos para brindar tratamiento profesional y de los requisitos para las clínicas de cesación del consumo de tabaco, así como de los criterios para la confidencialidad, seguimiento y egreso y especificaciones de los métodos alternativos.","Answer not provided","Elaboración de convenios con la industria farmacéutica","WHO Region of the Americas"

"145","Singapore","Since the last update,  HPB has implemented a targeted holistic tobacco control programme in schools with a high reported number of underage smokers. Schools are encouraged to implement a comprehensive tobacco control programme, focusing on both preventing initiation and supporting cessation for youth smokers. These cessation programmes for youth are underpinned by a strengths-based approach that seeks to harness positive aspects of the youth to bring about behaviour change. This approach is based on the understanding that youth will be more ready to address their problems when they feel empowered and more confident about their own abilities. 

HPB’s cessation programme helps youth channel their attention away from smoking and other risky behaviours by engaging in healthy activities aligned with their strengths. It also equips youth with the knowledge and skills to kick the habit and learn coping strategies to better deal with stress, anger, frustration or boredom. 

Student Health Advisors (SHAs) also provide tailored smoking cessation counselling to youth smokers in schools. Counselling sessions are conducted on an individual and/or group basis, depending on the youth’s specific needs and preferences.

Since 2016, HPB has also intensified and expanded smoking control programmes for uniformed services personnel. In the units that HPB is currently working with, a holistic health seminar, which covers a comprehensive range of health topics including smoking and alcohol use, is conducted for all recruits upon enlistment. This is followed up by an intensive group cessation programme where selected recruits (after a screening procedure to identify motivated quitters) undergo weekly customized activities designed to help them quit or reduce.

"159","The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia","Answer not provided","Answer not provided","Since 2012 the Institute for Pulmonary Diseases and Tuberculosis has counseling for prevention and quitting of smoking intended for persons who have ambulatory and inpatient treatment in this institution.
The results of the work of counseling are minimal compared to the results achieved in quitting of smoking because:
 level of knowledge about the harmful effects of smoking in patients smokers are at a low level
Generally patients smokers are unaware of the effects of smoking on the progression and frequent hospitalizations due to basic disease (HOBB astma tuberkuloza etc.)
Motivation to quit smoking is low
In 2012 in a small group of counseling participated 72 people of which 17 expressed wish to quit smoking and 3 quit the smoking.
In 2013 in a group of counseling participated 143 people in total in individual counseling - 19 people and 2 people are still in a phase of not smoking..
The reasons for this situation lies in the facts that:
Smoking has treatment as a socially acceptable form of behavior that does not compromise nor ill person nor his/her family.
Patients are adults with longstanding habits that are difficult to eradicate especially in the condition when there is lack of public disapproval for smoking. 
Ignorance about the harmful effects of smoking results in the fact that people are convinced that smokers can stop smoking whenever they want and when they need help.
The electronic cigarette is deeply entered in the market and is used more as a fashion detail but we still have no formal opinion if we can accept it as a method to stop smoking or not.","WHO European Region"
