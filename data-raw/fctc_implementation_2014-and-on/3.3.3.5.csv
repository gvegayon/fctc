Subject to any requirements under the scheme producers receive a certificate of quality as certification is free for manufacturers. By an Order of the Minister of Agriculture and Food ? RD 09-311/26.03.2012 are approved product specifications under the scheme to improve the quality of fruits and vegetables produced in Bulgaria. Orders and other information on the scheme are available at: www.mzh.government.bg heading CAP / Direct payments / Scheme to improve the quality of fruits and vegetables.
The budget for the scheme for 2014 is 37 million lev.
