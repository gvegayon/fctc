Apart from the contracts on diversification, MDA also contracted extension services on municipalities that produce tobacco, to assist another 33.400 families on other topics such as, agroecology, dairy activities, coffee production, and sustainability.
Furthermore, it has a specific item on its budget that supports training of farmers and extension agents, implementation of demonstration units on economic viable alternatives to tobacco, and research concerning diversification.","The National Program for Activities Diversification in Tobacco Growing Areas under the coordination of the Ministry of Agrarian Development (MDA ) was launched in 2005.

"49","Ecuador","Según el Ministerio de Industrias y Productividad (MIPRO), aproximadamente 650 agricultores independientes cultivan tabaco para las empresas tabacaleras en el país, principalmente en las provincias de Guayas y Los Ríos y se calcula que se siembran las siguientes clases de tabaco: Virginia, 800 a 1.000 ha/año. Burley, 300 ha/año. Con estas dos clases se elaboran los cigarrillos rubios y tabaco de capa (1.000 ha/año). El Ministerio de Agricultura y Ganadería (MAG), maneja programas o proyectos de apoyo relacionados al fomento de diversos cultivos para suplir el cultivo de tabaco.
El MIPRO estima que más de 500 personas trabajan en las tres empresas del país productoras de tabaco (ITABSA, TANASA, PROESA). Asimismo, esta Cartera de Estado no ha trabajado puntualmente en alternativas para redireccionar a la gente involucrada en esta industria hacia otras opciones. 
Sin embargo, se ha venido trabajando en un portafolio de proyectos los cuales comprenden cacao, café, pesca y lácteos, por lo que se podría coordinar propuestas que encadenen o anclen a esta fuerza laboral en otras cadenas productivas agroindustriales que se están fortaleciendo e incluso innovando en el país.
Según el MIPRO, el desplome del consumo de tabaco nacional ha provocado que algunos agricultores ya no tengan cupos de compra y a otros desde el año 2016 les redujeron la superficie de siembra, resultando en que un porcentaje de agricultores de tabaco cambien su producción a cadenas de valor bien cimentadas como el cacao, ya que la constante alza de la demanda y el precio   le convierten en la alternativa de producción más viable. En varias zonas de Milagro y Jujan los ex tabacaleros se volcaron a la pepa, siendo una solución viable que debería ser impulsada por el MAG, anclada al perfeccionamiento de propuestas que se han venido trabajando por parte del MIPRO, con el fin de fortalecer y beneficiar la cadena del cacao y por ende necesitar de mayores superficies de siembra y por supuesto de fuerza laboral.","En el país, si se ha llevado a cabo este tipo de actividades, no han sido socializadas.","Answer not provided","WHO Region of the Americas"

"150","Spain","Report not provided","En España, se pueden distinguir dos tipos de apoyo a la diversificación del cultivo del tabaco: ayudas nacionales y ayudas cofinanciadas por Fondo Europeo Agrícola de Desarrollo Rural (FEADER).
1.	Ayudas nacionales: Ayudas a la diversificación y dinamización económica de municipios tabaqueros. En 2013, En Extremadura se convocó una ayuda dotada de 8.500.000 euros (Decreto 42/2013, de 26 de marzo, por el que se establecen las bases reguladoras de la concesión de ayudas para la diversificación y dinamización económica de municipios tabaqueros, y se dispone la convocatoria para el ejercicio 2013). El sector primario está excluido de esta ayuda y están incluidos los sectores secundario y terciario. Se han aprobado 228 expedientes.
El 10 de octubre de 2011, se suscribió un  convenio de colaboración entre el Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Medio Rural y Marino y la Consejería de Agricultura, Desarrollo Rural, Medio Ambiente y Energía de la Junta de Extremadura, para la realización de un programa de desarrollo rural sostenible en las comarcas tabaqueras extremeñas. El convenio de suscribió como consecuencia de la inclusión en la Ley 39/2010, de 22 de diciembre, de presupuestos Generales del Estado para el año 2011 como una subvención nominativa, con una dotación de 9.000.000 de euros. A fin de desarrollar las actuaciones descritas en el convenio, la Consejería de Agricultura estableció mediante el Decreto 42/2013, de 26 de marzo, las bases reguladoras para la concesión de ayudas en concurrencia competitiva, para la diversificación y dinamización económica de municipios con clara vocación tabaquera, así como en su área de influencia.
El convenio, con un acuerdo de modificación y prórroga incluido, terminó el 31 de diciembre de 2014, en estos momentos la Comisión de Seguimiento del convenio está gestionando su cierre y liquidación.
Al amparo del convenio se han certificado 167 expedientes suponiendo un gasto con cargo al convenio de 5.705.893,07 de euros, incluyendo una asistencia técnica para la realización, entre otros, de trabajos de apoyo a la gestión de la línea de ayudas a la diversificación y dinamización económica de los municipios tabaqueros con un coste de 259.557,57 euros, la diferencia entre la dotación inicial del convenio (9.000.000 de euros) y la cantidad justificada se devolverá por parte de la Junta de Extremadura al Tesoro Público. 
2.	Ayudas cofinanciadas por el FEADER: Existen tres programas de desarrollo rural (PDR) FEADER que contienen ayudas a la diversificación del tabaco: Castilla y León, Andalucía y Extremadura.
Andalucía: El Programa de Desarrollo Rural (PDR) de Andalucía, para el marco 2007-2013, recogía la Medida 144 ""Explotaciones en proceso de reestructuración con motivo de la reforma de la OCM del tabaco"", que tenía como beneficiarios a los tabaqueros que realizaran una diversificación económica hacia otras actividades tanto agrarias como no agrarias. Esta medida tenía una financiación asignada de un gasto público que ascendía a un montante de 1.584.606 euros para el marco 2007-2013.
No obstante, el actual Programa de Desarrollo Rural (PDR) de Andalucía, en su marco 2014-2020, no recoge operaciones específicas destinadas a la diversificación del sector del tabaco.
Extremadura: Los proyectos de diversificación del sector tabaquero se incluyen en el PDR 2007-2013 de Extremadura dentro de la medida 413 (aplicación de estrategias de desarrollo local), que comprendía  actividades de diversificación hacia actividades no agrícolas, ayuda a la creación y desarrollo de microempresas y fomento de actividades turísticas. Toda la medida 413 tiene una asignación financiera de 10.607.903 euros (en este montante se incluye tanto las actuaciones dirigidas al sector tabaquero como a otros sectores).
Castilla y León: En el periodo 2012-2014 se apoyó la reconversión de las explotaciones que iniciaran otra actividad con abandono progresivo del cultivo del tabaco.
En la actualidad no se concede ayuda alguna en este ámbito.","Answer not provided","WHO European Region"
