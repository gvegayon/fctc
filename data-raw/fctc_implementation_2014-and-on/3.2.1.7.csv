a dos años de aplicadas las medidas fiscales existen evidencias de los efectos en materia de fiscal. lo que deja en claro su efectividad en el aumento de la recaudación a partir del ISC y en una reducción de la demanda ante el incremento del precio de los productos derivados del tabaco. específicamente de los cigarrillos. 
el incremento de la renta nacional por habitante en períodos cortos. han podido haber neutralizado en parte el efecto del incremento del ISC y hacer más asequible el consumo de cigarrillos y otros derivados del tabaco a corto plazo.
el modelo que presentó el mejor ajuste fue el convencional. con una elasticidad precio de -0.82. dejando un umbral de incremento del ISC en 12%. a dos años del último incremento del 100%. se partió de un precio promedio por cajetilla de 20 cigarrillos de B/. 3.63 que considera las 3 marcas más vendidas en el país. frente al precio promedio de finales de 2009. de B/. 1.83. 
la Curva de Laffer. solo plantea un escenario probable sobre la base del descenso de las importaciones a lo largo del período de estudio. El signo negativo de la elasticidad ingreso de la demanda en todos los modelos ha sido objeto de amplio debate. 
las series históricas evidencian una relación inversa entre el ingreso y consumo. desde principios del período de estudio. lo cual deja abierta la posibilidad de sesgo derivado de sub declaraciones aduaneras y de impuestos o el contrabando. 
Los resultados reflejan que las medidas impositivas se han estrechado. momentáneamente ante el último incremento del ISC. Un tema pendiente de mayor debate es que las elasticidades no son estáticas en el tiempo. lo cual deja siempre abierta la posibilidad de cambios estructurales en el consumo que pueden afectar la interpretación de la Curva de Laffer. lo cual deja en claro su limitación respecto de consideraciones impositivas a largo plazo. 

El estudio se complementó con los análisis de las encuestas de marcas y de percepción de los efectos de las medidas de control en locales de esparcimiento y diversión y se contrastó con los resultados preliminares de la encuesta GATS. Panamá -2013.
