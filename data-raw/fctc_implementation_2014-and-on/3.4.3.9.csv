Within this framework, on 30 June 2015 The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) concluded the Administrative Arrangement (AA) providing €225 000 through Hercule III, with the Joint Research Centre – Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements (JRC-IRMM) on “Setting up a laboratory facility and associated data management for the independent analysis of tobacco products” (TOBLAB). The Laboratory is now becoming fully operational and aims to provide the Member States and OLAF with opportunities to independently test cigarettes and other tobacco products in order to:

- track their geographical origin
- establish if they are counterfeit
- build a relevant database for sharing the results of analysis.

Furthermore, in October 2014, OLAF, in close cooperation with Member States, launched a new IT Tobacco Seizure Management Application (""ToSMA"") set up under the umbrella of the Anti-Fraud Information System (AFIS), an IT platform which comprehensively analyses data on cigarette seizures reported by the Member States.","1.
