"7","Australia","Report not provided","This reporting instrument is far less user friendly that the 2014 report. This instrument does not allow for collaboration across and within Government, as there is no way to save externally and allow the WHO FCTC focal points to seek additional information that falls outside the health scope. For example, to ensure accuracy, Australia usually sends the report to colleagues at customs and  tax offices to ensure we report accurate seizure and tax information. This was not possible with this report as we couldnt guarantee that unrelated answers wouldnt be changed by accident, and the submitting officer needs to be accountable for all responses in the instrument. 

Further, Australia assumes that we will be sent our final responses for official record keeping purposes, but in the absence of this, the new instrument does not allow Parties to take responsibly for their own record keeping.  We note this is particularly important for consistency of responses between reporting periods.  

Australia had many problems with saving our responses, with the internet connection timing out and cutting out many times, resulting in the reporting instrument having to be reviewed many more times than in previous years, to ensure that input was saved as intended. 

Australia would welcome a return to the old reporting instrument.","Answer not provided","WHO Western Pacific Region"

It would also be helpful if the % of survey completed was updated each time a response is entered and is relevant to the whole survey, not just certain sections.

With this new instrument, we experienced some difficulties - there were times that we had to restart all over again as we were not prompted to the sections we left blank or to continue, and sometimes the page did not save the answers automatically - all of which is due to our slow internet connection.
