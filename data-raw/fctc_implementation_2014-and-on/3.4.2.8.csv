She had started smoking in the early 1960s at the age of 12. Rolah sued BAT arguing that it had been negligent in its manufacturing and marketing of cigarettes, and that its negligence had caused her lung cancer. She sought damages. Rolah argued that BAT knew that cigarettes were addictive and dangerous to health, took no reasonable steps to reduce the risk of addiction or the health risks, targeted children in its advertising, and ignored or publicly disparaged research results which indicated the health risks of smoking. In April 2002, Rolah became the first person outside of the US to obtain a verdict against the tobacco industry in a personal injury claim, though the verdict was overturned on appeal later that year.","Answer not provided","WHO Western Pacific Region"

"22","Brazil","Report not provided","There is still not a specific legislation in Brazil regarding liability measures in relation to any injury or adverse health effect caused by tobacco use.
However, since the submission of our last report, the Brazilian Government is gathering information about liability actions, in the field of doctrine and jurisprudence, based on national and international law, which may be used with tobacco control purpose.
In terms of Brazilian legislation, there are general civil liability provisions that could apply to tobacco control. The Brazilian Civil Code (Law n. 10.406) establishes that who causes damage through an illicit conduct shall repair it. There is such obligation even in the absence of fault, when the activity normally performed by the wrongdoer implies, by its own nature, risks to the rights of another person (article 927).
The Brazilian Consumers Code (Law n. 8.078) affirms that consumers have the right to clear and suitable information on products and services, including the correct description of composition and characteristics, as well as the right to protection against the risks caused by abusive and misleading advertisement of products and services (article 6).
There are civil liability actions launched by persons before Brazilian courts, but the Judiciary, in general, has not granted liability orders. In a near future, there is a strong possibility that the Brazilian Government itself start to launch a lawsuit order to recover the health care costs paid by the public health care system.","The Law n. 12.546 provides fiscal. administrative (or civil) and criminal sanctions to violation of tax regimes and illicit trade of cigarettes in certain circumstances. Article 19 applies fiscal sanctions (fines and interests) to the violation of the special regime of the Industrialized Products Tax (IPI) applied to cigarettes in certain circumstances. Article 20. §1º. moreover. allows the Federal Revenue Secretariat to apply administrative forfeiture of cigarettes commercialized under the minimum retail price established by the government. without prejudice to the relevant criminal sanctions in case of illicit importation. The company that sells cigarette under the minimum retail price shall be also prohibited to commercialize it for five years (article 20. §2º).
There is no specific legislation in Brazil regarding liability measures in relation to any injury or adverse health effect caused by tobacco use.
There are. however. general civil liability provisions that could apply to tobacco control. The Brazilian Civil Code (Law n. 10.406) establishes that who causes damage through an illicit conduct shall repair it. There is such obligation even in the absence of fault. when the activity normally performed by the wrongdoer implies. by its own nature. risks to the rights of another person (article 927).

There are civil liability actions launched by persons before Brazilian courts. but the Judiciary. in general. has not granted liability orders.
The Superior Labour Court. however. granted a compensation order of R$ 500.000.00 (aprox. USD 220.000.00) to a person who worked as a cigarette taster for 10 years to Souza Cruz S.A (a Brazilian tobacco company) and got pulmonary diseases as a consequence of his functions (Docket RR 129100-11.2006.5.01.0045).","WHO Region of the Americas"

"29","Canada","Report not provided","In April 2012, JTI-Macdonald Corp. (JTI) and Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. (ITC) each launched constitutional challenges to the Tobacco Products Labelling Regulations (Cigarettes and Little Cigars).  They asserted that the increase in size of health warning messages from 50 percent to 75 percent of the packages of tobacco products violates the corporations’ right to freedom of expression under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The companies may file additional fact affidavits in the future.  The hearing of the challenges is currently set to take place over three days in early 2017. 

All Canadian provinces and territories except Yukon have passed legislation to enable the pursuit of health care cost recovery actions against tobacco companies. All ten provinces have now launched actions seeking to recover health care costs from tobacco companies.   Canada was named as a third party in three of these actions (i.e., British Columbia, New Brunswick and Ontario).  The third party claims against Canada have been struck in the BC case (Supreme Court of Canada decision of 2011) and the New Brunswick case (New Brunswick Court of Queen’s Bench decision of 2012) while in the Ontario Health Care Cost recovery, the three tobacco companies discontinued their third party claims against Canada on September 24, 2014. 

In the Blais and Létourneau class actions, the Quebec Court of Appeal struck out the tobacco companies actions in warranty against Canada in November 2012.  As a result, Canada is no longer a party to the actions that were brought against JTI-MacDonald Corp, Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd and Rothmans, Benson & Hedges on behalf of approximately one million Quebecers suffering from tobacco-related diseases or addicted to nicotine. On June 9, 2015 the trial judge granted the plaintiffs’ claims in part and awarded damages totalling over $15 billion.  On October 27, 2015, the Court of Appeal granted the plaintiffs’ motions for security pending the appeal of the Superior Court’s decision of June 9. ITC and RBH were ordered to furnish just under $1 billion in security.","All Canadian provinces have passed legislation to enable the pursuit of health care cost recovery actions against tobacco companies. The following provinces have now launched actions seeking to recover health care costs from tobacco companies: BC. Alberta. Saskatchewan. Manitoba. Ontario. Quebec. New Brunswick. PEI and Newfoundland. Canada was named as a third party in 3 of these actions. in BC. New Brunswick and Ontario. The third party claims against Canada have been struck in the BC case (Supreme Court of Canada decision of 2011) and New Brunswick cases (NB Court of Queen''s Bench decision of 2012).

In the $27B class action known as Blais and Létourneau. the Quebec Court of Appeal struck out the tobacco companies'' actions in warranty against Canada in November 2012. As a result. Canada is no longer a party to these ongoing actions.

Two tobacco companies have also challenged the Tobacco Products Labelling Regulations (Cigarettes and Little Cigars). specifically the provision that increased the size of health warning messages on cigarette and little cigar packaging from 50% to 75%.","WHO Region of the Americas"
