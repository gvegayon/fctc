"125","Philippines","The CSC, the DOH, and non-governmental institutions involved in the tobacco control policies are at the forefront in conducting orientations on the JMC to government officials and employees, through the Accountability Seminar on Tobacco Industry Interference (ASTII). From 2016 to 2017, all local government units (LGUs) were capacitated relative to the implementation of Article 5.3; as well as forty eight (48) national government agencies. Further, Kkowledge products on countering tobacco industry interference (i.e. modules, IEC materials) were developed and were used by different agencies such as the Office of the President. There were also coordination meetings among members of NTCC Article 5.3 where strategic plans and programs were discussed. Complaints relative to possible violation of Article 5.3 from 2016-2017 were reported and filed before the Office of the Ombudsman for appropriate legal action. The CSC and the DOH are actively coordinating with agencies whenever the latter seek legal advice in addressing challenges relative to tobacco industry interference. 

The Philippines have also provided technical assistance on Article 5.3 during the South-South and Triangular Cooperation held in Brazil last May 2017.  

During the Asean Conference on Civil Service Matters, the Philippines presented the JMC 2010-01 and Article 5.3 among Asean member states. Also, CSC attended as member of delegates to the COP7 and presented the JMC 2010-01 as best practice in implementing Article 5.3 in the Philippines during the side meeting of the conference.","To date, a total of 216 orientations on the JMC had been conducted by the Civil Service Commission (CSC), Department of Health (DOH), Framework Convention Alliance Philippines (FCAP) and Health Justice (HJ) to various government officials, administrative officers, legal officers and other employees. Several orientations had also been given by the CSC and DOH Regional Offices to their respective constituents and other regional agencies.  A total of 70 agencies both at the national, regional and local government level had adopted the JMC policy in their respective agencies. 

The Article 5.3 Sub-committee led by the CSC continues to hold regular meetings to act on reported violations of the JMC. The Sub-committee continues to monitor and hear reports on violations. The online reporting mechanism for complaints against violations of the JMC, which is coursed through the CSC Help Desk: Contact Center ng Bayan, remains to be available for reporting from the public. 

Moreover, the Philippines through the CSC was also designated as a Technical Assistance provider for Article 5.3 to other countries under the South-South and Triangular and Cooperation Meeting.","On Policy Development
There was an increase in the number of agencies that have adopted the Article 5.3 after the issuance of the CSC-DOH JMC 2010-01. The Department of Education Commission on Higher Education Department of Science and Technology Department of Labor and Employment Land and Transportation Franchising Regulatory Board and the Bureau of Internal Revenue to name a few have issued their respective policies adopting the JMC. Fairly recently LGUs are beginning to adopt the JMC. In 2013 the Municipal Government of Balungao in Pangasinan a tobacco producing province in Northern Luzon adopted the JMC through an Executive Order issued by its Mayor. 
Incidents of TI Interference
The JMC did not instantly deter the industry from interfering with the setting and implementation of tobacco control policies in the different branches of government. Monitoring reports from various tobacco control groups show that the national government agencies continue to experience TI interference. The industry also continue to dissuade local government units from adopting an FCTC compliant ordinance. News in different media outlets report of the assumed partnership between the industry and several elective and appointive government officials. Despite all the reports no formal complaint for violation of the JMC has been filed with the CSC and the Office of the Ombudsman (OMB). Notable however is the gradual decline in the number of TII incidents monitored by allied agencies and partner CSOs.
The presence of the Philippine Tobacco Institute (PTI) in the Inter-Agency Committee-Tobacco (IACT) the implementing body of the Tobacco Regulation Act is a glaring fact that the tobacco industry''s participation in policy development has been institutionalized. The existence of the National Tobacco Administration (NTA) is a matter that needs to be thoroughly studied with the end goal of ensuring that the Philippine government is consistent in its tobacco control policy. 
In the recent past the CSC and DOH received letters from the Northern Luzon Alliance Group seeking the revocation of the JMC. During budget hearings both leaders of said institutions thoroughly questioned by the same members of the Congress about the legality of the JMC.
Enforcing Article 5.3 through the CSC-The Union Project.
The CSC and Bloomberg Initiative agreed to undertake an 18-month Project to implement the JMC. Through the Project the CSC as Co-Chair of the Sector-Wide Anti-Tobacco (SWAT) Article 5.3 Sub-Committee is able to quarterly convene this multi-sectoral tobacco control group to discuss issues on interference and agree on strategies to prevent and address the same. It is currently in the process of developing the Committee''s Strategic Work Plan and Communication Plan. 
Through the CSC the SWAT 5.3 was able to call the attention of the IACT to ensure that no proposal by the Philippine Tobacco Institute should be adopted by the body. Likewise CSC sent letters reminding","WHO Western Pacific Region"

Through this plan, the Government committed to delivering further transparency and publishing the details of all policy related meetings between the tobacco industry and Government Departments.  This excludes meetings to discuss illicit trade and bilateral meetings between tobacco companies and HM Revenue and Customs.  As per FCTC recommendations, face-to-face interactions with tobacco manufacturers are limited to practical matters. Notes from these meetings are published on the DH website.  

Public consultation documents concerning  Tobacco Control  ask all respondents to disclose whether they have any direct or indirect links to, or receive funding from, the tobacco industry. The tobacco industry is purposefully not involved in the development of tobacco control strategies. 

Local authorities are encouraged to follow the Governments lead in this area.

In December 2013, The Department of Health  held a two day workshop for other government departments on interaction with the tobacco industry. The purpose of the workshop was to raise awareness of the influence the tobacco industry can and has had on policy, to encourage Departments to limit interactions with the tobacco industry and ensure the transparency of those interactions that occur.

Supplementary guidance has been developed to ensure compliance across the Trading Standards Institute (‘TSI’) and local authority trading standards departments (‘TSDs’) who have cause to engage with the tobacco industry regarding counterfeit and illicit tobacco.

Over 100 local authorities have also voluntarily signed the Local Government Declaration on Tobacco Control which relates to Article 5.3 of the world’s first global public health treaty, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The declaration states that:
