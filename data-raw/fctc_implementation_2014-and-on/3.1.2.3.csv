 The Staff Regulations for officials of the European Union contain legally binding ethical standards and ensure that the principles of independence, impartiality, objectivity and loyalty are applied in the European Public Service. Notably the principle of independence guarantees that conduct and decision-making are determined by the need to serve the common good and the public interest, and never by any other interests.
 As regards transparency, Regulation 1049/2001 on public access to documents is an important element, flanked by the other aspects of the Commissions transparency policy, such as the Transparency Register, and the proactive publication of information on meetings held by Commissioners, members of their cabinets and Directors-General with stakeholders. As of 1 December 2014, Commissioners, their Cabinet members and Directors General publish information on the meetings they hold with lobbyists. Moreover, they meet only with interest representatives whose organisations feature on the Transparency Register. As concerns other staff members, the Commission recommends to all staff to check the credentials of a given interest representative to make sure they are registered in the Transparency Register and, if they are not, encourage them to register. The Commission constantly promotes this ""good practice"" as part of its training and awareness-raising actions on relations with interest groups. Furthermore, the European Commission has endorsed the ""Practical recommendations for public officials’ interaction with interest representatives"" issued by the European Ombudsman in May 2017 and has disseminated them internally.","The ethical and integrity rules (notably Staff Regulations, Code of Conduct for Commissioners and Code of Good Administrative Behaviour), as well as the rules on access to documents and on transparency regarding relations with interest representatives, constitute a framework which is consistent with the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), and ensures that the FCTC is respected including its provision on protecting public health policies from commercial and other vested interests of the tobacco industry.

March 15, 2012 8:13 pm. UK diplomat accused of tobacco lobbying
By Kiran Stacey and Rose Jacobs
A senior British diplomat has been accused of breaking UK and international health guidelines by lobbying his host government on behalf of a tobacco company, in a sign of the ethical dilemmas thrown up by the foreign office drive to promote British industry abroad.
The Financial Times has obtained a letter written by Michael John Holloway, UK ambassador to Panama, in which he raises concern over the “alarming growth” of contraband cigarettes and the “critical situation” this has caused for British American Tobacco, which he describes as “one of the most important British companies”.

La IT trató de obtener cita con autoridades individuales, violentando la disposición del MINSA que indica que solamente la Comisión Nacional para el Estudio del Tabaquismo es la llamada a atender todos los temas relacionados con el control de Tabaco.
