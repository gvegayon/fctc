"29","Canada","CancerCare Manitoba offers a Quit Smoking Program (QSP) to patients, their families and staff. The program includes an interdisciplinary clinic involving a nurse practitioner, nurse, social worker, pharmacist and pharmacy technician. The clinic’s services help participants deal with the emotional and physical aspects of quitting smoking through a full range of supportive cessation treatments. Patients are screened, assessed, counselled and provided treatment of nicotine replacement and drug therapy at no cost to participants. 

In January, 2016 up to $1.0 million in new funding was provided for the implementation of a provincial nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) program that provides, free of charge, up to 8 weeks of NRT annually to eligible smokers looking to quit. 

In Ontario, one of Canadas sub-national jurisdiction, new social marketing campaigns were implemented that targets adult regular smokers, and public education campaigns were implemented to advise the public about new smoking regulations.  The 2015 Pan American and Parapan American Games were hosted in the City of Toronto and declared smoke-free and secondly, as a legacy component, the public was educated about the importance of smoke-free outdoor public spaces, particularly sporting fields.

The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), a federal partner in Canadas Federal Tobacco Control Strategy, co-funded a number of tobacco projects designed to promote healthy living and to prevent chronic disease.  

•	Led by Manitoba Tobacco Reduction Alliance, the MANTRA project is establishing a certification program in tobacco addiction treatment at University of Manitoba and expanding Cancer Care Manitoba’s Quit Smoking Program to seven outreach centres across the province. The MANTRA project complements the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer work to better integrate tobacco cessation into cancer care settings to improve patient access to healthcare professionals trained in tobacco addiction treatment. Partners for this project include Cancer Care Manitoba and Canadian Network for Respiratory Care. The project expects to reach 250 healthcare professionals.

•	The Picking Up the PACE project led by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) is enhancing the content of online training and implementing a peer coaching model with the aim of increasing the ability of healthcare professionals to offer interventions to address modifiable risk factors and improve smoking cessation outcomes. CAMH is partnering with the Medical Psychiatry Alliance in the development of the content that will be used with 350 healthcare providers in Ontario and will inform the online component of the Training Enhancement in Applied Cessation Counselling and Health (TEACH), an evidence-based program accredited by the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine, professional regulatory bodies and the international Association for the Treatment of Tobacco Use and Dependence.

•	Evidence in the field of tobacco control recognizes the relationship between tobacco cessation behaviour and other risk factors (e.g., unhealthy eating and inactivity) and identifies the need for chronic disease prevention strategies that address these interrelated risks.  As a result a more recent, Canada-wide project called Run to Quit was launched, in partnership with the Canadian Cancer Society and the Running Room, to implement a tobacco cessation project while improving physical activity levels. Early results showed that 28% of participants had quit smoking and had successfully not smoked in six months. In addition, 43% of participants interviewed said they were still running, on average, three times a week. Participants also noted increased physical and mental wellbeing and confidence to quit smoking. These results are encouraging since rates for people trying to quit “cold turkey” average around 4%.

The Province of Alberta provides a number of resources which target under aged girls, young women, and pregnant women. These include the ""Reproductive Years Guidelines"" for health care providers which was designed to assist health care providers in supporting women and girls to stop or reduce the use of tobacco. They also provide a practical hands on guide entitled ""Baby Steps Help Guide"" for health care providers working with girls and women who use tobacco and tobacco-like products and are planning a pregnancy, are pregnant, or postpartum.","CancerCare Manitoba offers a Quit Smoking Program (QSP) to patients, their families and staff.

The ""Enhancing the Capacity of Health Care Professionals to Integrate Evidence-based Smoking Cessation Interventions"", led by the Canadian Network for Respiratory Care (CNRC), developed a competency based tobacco cessation training curriculum and certification program targeting health care providers. The aim was to develop the most current information on tobacco cessation interventions and prevention, and to ensure that health care providers stay up-to-date with advancement in these areas through a rigorous recertification process and continuing education in order to maintain their credentials. Partners included Pear Healthcare, iMD Health, Pfizer Canada Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada, Professional Targeted Marketing, University of Ottawa Heart Institute. 

Led by the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, the aim of the ""National Smoking Cessation Program in Respiratory and Diabetes Education Clinics (INSPIRE)""  was to integrate evidence-based smoking cessation practices and services in respiratory and diabetes clinics in Ontario, British Columbia and New Brunswick. The project was initiated as an expansion of a program already running in cardiovascular care clinics across Canada. It encouraged health care providers to support evidence-based smoking cessation intervention within their practice. Partners included Pfizer Canada, Pfizer GRAND and the Government of New Brunswick Canada. 

Led by the Manitoba Tobacco Reduction Alliance, the ""MANTRA project"" will establish a certification program in tobacco addiction treatment at the University of Manitoba so that more healthcare professionals can be trained in smoking cessation counselling. The project will also expand Cancer Care Manitoba’s Quit Smoking program from one to seven outreach centres across the province,  creating opportunities for more Manitobans to have access to healthcare professionals trained specifically in tobacco addiction treatment who can guide and support patients in their efforts to quit smoking. This project was launched in 2015 and complements the work of the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer to better integrate tobacco cessation into cancer care settings in Manitoba. Partners include Cancer Care Manitoba and Canadian Network for Respiratory Care. 

Run to Quit is planned for August 2015 with the aim of decreasing tobacco use among Canadians while increasing physical activity by incorporating an evidence-based smoking cessation curriculum with a coach-led program. Over the next five years, the Canadian Cancer Society will implement this innovative smoking cessation program in partnership with Running Room Canada. Based on Running Room’s proven method, the Run to Quit program provides a gentle, progressive running program to meet participants at their own fitness level, while at the same time offering an evidence-based, comprehensive 10-week program curriculum that teaches participants effective ways to quit smoking.","Answer not provided","WHO Region of the Americas"

At the 3rd reporting period we regarded the smoking cessation clinic at health community centre as specialized centre. However this response is overlapped with primary health care.

In regards to 3.2.8.8 there is no separate restriction for smoking cessation counselling so other medical professionals are also able to provide counselling. In addition only the person who owned a nurse license is able to be a midwivf in Korea. 

In regards to 3.2.8.9 answer medical and pharmacy schools'' curriculum include diagnosis and inspection on smoking and drugs. In the case of dental schools the relations among smoking tartar cavity and oral cancer are addressed. Nursing school teaches intervention on smoking cessation treatment in social nursing. Lastly in the curriculum of public health school smoking is included in pathology reporting and diagnosis.


To support the smokers the smoking cessation clinic at health community centre which mentioned on 3.2.8.11. Furthermore a quitline and website have operated by National Cancer Centre. A quitline(1544-9030) has implemented since 2006 and provided 1 year counselling to smokers via telephone. Through online it has offered useful information about smoking cessation and smoking prevention (http://www.nosmokeguide.or.kr/).","WHO Western Pacific Region"
