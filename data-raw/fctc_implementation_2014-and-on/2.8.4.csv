These annual excise increases will continue between 2018 and 2020 inclusive.
In addition, Australia is the only country in the world to index tobacco excise to wage inflation average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) to ensure that tobacco products do not become relatively more affordable over time.
These increases are expected to bring the percentage of excise tax in the retail price of cigarettes in Australia much closer to the WHO recommended benchmark of 70%. Whilst the Government has been active in raising the excise on tobacco products, the tobacco industry routinely increases its prices, which affects the Government’s ability to maintain this ratio.
As part of the 2017-18 Federal Budget, ‘roll-your-own’ and other tobacco products such as cigars were subject to the same tax treatment as manufactured cigarettes. It is intended that this measure will ensure fairness and efficiency in tobacco taxes by bringing the taxation of
 roll-your-own tobacco products in line with manufactured cigarettes.
Australia also applies a goods and service tax to tobacco products, as such, as outlined above in B83, the amount of 60.31% tobacco tax to tobacco retail prices relates to total taxes (excise plus goods and service tax).

Adopté dans le cadre de la Loi de financement de la sécurité sociale 2018, des augmentations de la fiscalité de tous les produits du tabac sont prévues jusqu’en 2020. Les références déclarées à la Direction général de douanes en février 2018, montrent que le prix du paquet de 20 cigarettes augmente, en moyenne, de presque 1 euro (94 centimes). Les prix homologués des paquets de 20 cigarettes s’établissent entre 7,50 euros et 9,10 euros. Le prix moyen du paquet de 20 cigarettes des références homologuées est d’environ 7,90 € (contre 7 € depuis novembre 2017). Concernant les conditionnements standards de tabac à rouler, les prix homologués des blagues de 30 grammes sont en hausse de 2 euros en moyenne et s’établissent entre 9,50 euros et 11,10 euros.

La remise brute allouée au débitant de tabac est de 8.74% du prix de vente au détail. Le droit de consommation est de 64.7% qui se décompose en une part proportionnelle au prix de vente au détail de 49.7 % et une part spécifique en euros pour 1000 cigarettes de 45.75 €.

For cigarettes this includes import duty (20% Cost Insurance and Freight (CIF)) import sales tax (15% CIF plus duty) excise tax (165 dalasi per kilo) environment tax customs processing fees and 0.50% ECOWAS levy. For other tobacco products the excise tax is exempted; environment tax is increased to 75 dalasi per kg with the rest remaining the same as cigarettes resulting in lower taxation level of the other tobacco products. Over the recent years there is modest increase of tobacco taxation but the retail price has remained stable. Given the inflation rate is about 4.5% there is actually a real decrease to tobacco products which makes them more affordable and accessible. Increased tobacco taxation is one of the most effective demand side reduction measures particularly for the poor and the youth. The Gambia is in the process of introducing 15% ad valorem rate (VAT) tobacco tax next year but the excise taxation should also be considered. The Gambia Ministry of Finance and the Gambia Revenue Authority recognizes that price and tax measures are an effective and important means of reducing tobacco consumption and supports progressively higher taxation on tobacco products.

Excise tax is levied on excisable goods produced in Montenegro and excise goods which are imported in Montenegro.

Further harmonization of definition of tobacco products (cigarettes cigars and cigarillos fine cut tobacco and other smoking tobacco) with the relevant regulations in the EU is carried out and with the relevant Directive of Council of the EU 2011/64 on the structure and rates of excise duty on tobacco produces.

According to recent amendments of the Law on to the Excise Tax the specific excise tax on cigarettes have been increased from 15 € per 1000 pieces (0.30 € per pack) to € 17.50 (0.35 € per pack) and a proportional reduction in the rate from the current 36%  to 35% of the retail price of cigarettes in order to gradually approach a binding minimum amount of excise tax in the EU according to which the minimum amount of excise duty on cigarettes may not be less than the amount corresponding to 57% of the retail price of cigarettes in the most popular price range provided that the amount cannot be under 64 € / kg. Since 1st January 2014 mandatory minimum in the EU will be 90 € / 1000 pcs. Or  60% of the weighted average price of cigarettes.

 The way of determining minimum excise tax is prescribed by applying the average retail selling price of cigarettes (''weighted average price'') instead of until now ''popular prices'' as basis for calculation of minimum excise tax on cigarettes.

In 2015, the tax base for cigars and cigarillos has been changed from per 1000 pieces to per kilogram basis.

As the excise duty rate for one cigar was much lower in comparison  to excise duty rate for smoking tobacco, this phenomenon generated losses to the State budget and the legislation needed to be changed.

Until 12.07.2012 the combined excise tax was 35 % of the retail price and 0.10 MKD denars per piece. A minimum amount of excise duty has not been applied. With the amendments to the Law on excise duties the combined excise was accounted for 9% from the retail price and 1 30 MKD denars per piece. If the combined excise is below the amount of 1 50 MKD denars per piece a minimum excise tax is applied in that amount.

Answer from the Ministry of Finance:
For the purposes of fiscal policies in order to support economic growth in June 2013 unification of excise duty on tobacco products was proposed regulated by the Law on excise taxes and fees on tobacco products regulated by the Law on Environment Law on tobacco and tobacco products and Law for healthcare by transforming the tobacco fees into combined excise. With combining the excise and fees on cigarettes from 1.07.2013 the taxation will be on:

1 July 2013 (Ad valorem 9%+specific 1 3 MKD denars min. 1 5 MKD denars)

The main reason for initiating the amendments of the Law on Excise was a need to improve the excise policy in several segments. Considering the gradual increase in excise duty on certain products to countries in the region and the need for gradual adjustment to the level of excise taxes in European Union countries a gradual increase in excise taxes on tobacco products in the Republic of Macedonia have been proposed. 
This is in order to raise the excise tax in the country for tobacco goods that in the future should be comply to reach levels of excise specified in the European Union. At the moment there are no socio - economic conditions for accession to directly comply with the EU directives and hence in order to protect the living standards of the population the approach taken is to access to a moderate increase of the excise burden on tobacco. Increases in the amount of excise tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products is also aimed at reducing the consumption of these products and the protection of public health in the country.","WHO European Region"
