Under current Australian laws, persons must be a minimum of 18 years of age to access tobacco and tobacco products in Australia.  
All Australian states and territories prohibit the sale of single cigarettes and mandate the minimum number of cigarettes in a pack (20 cigarettes), reasoning that small packs, being less expensive, are more attractive to youth.  

The majority of states and territories have existing legislation controlling the sale and/or marketing of overtly fruit or confectionery-flavoured tobacco products and prohibit the manufacturing and sale of tobacco products resembling toys (on the basis of protecting young people from taking up smoking). In addition states and territories require signage at points of sale, warning of the legal age restriction, and also require the purchaser of tobacco products to provide appropriate evidence of having reached full legal age.  

The Australian Capital Territory legislates e-cigarettes as smoking products, making their sale to minors illegal.
Australian state and territory legislation prohibits or restricts the display of tobacco products at points of sale. The sale of cigarettes in vending machines is also restricted in states and territories in the following ways: 
• In Victoria, vending machines for operation by the public must be positioned in sight of the service counter in bars, casinos and bottle shops.  

•In the Australian Capital Territory vending machines may not be used by the public to purchase smoking products.
• In New South Wales, vending machines are only allowed in licensed premises restricted to individuals over the age of 18, and like the Australian Capital Territory, may only be operated by staff intervention. 
• Queensland, Tasmania, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory all have measures in place to ensure that tobacco vending machines are not accessible to minors and do not promote the sale of tobacco products to minors.

Further, some jurisdictions have banned the sale of ENDS/ENNDS to minors.  

In Tasmania, penalties for sale and supply of tobacco to minors were significantly increased to a maximum fine of $19,000 for a first offence, $38,000 for a second offence and $57,000 for a further offence.  The sale or supply of electronic cigarettes to a person under 18 years is also banned.  New laws also enable a fit and proper test on applicants for a licence to sell tobacco products and electronic cigarettes.

In consequence of the Act, selling of tobacco products can only be permitted in supervised tobacco stores, where only adults above 18 can purchase. The aim of the Act is to restrict the widespread availability and presence of tobacco products in order to promote tobacco control among young people, furthermore to supply smokers with tobacco products professionally and satisfyingly in compliance with consumer protection rules, thereby to prevent the illegal trade of tobacco products.
As a result of the Act, from 1st July 2013, tobacco products can only be purchased in 7000 supervised tobacco stores with concession, instead of in more than 40 000 shops all over the country before. At retail, young people need to be prevented from buying tobacco products as much as possible. If there is a doubt about the age of the customer, the retailer must check the documents proving the age of the customer. In case of contravening these requirements, the consumer protection agency can impose a fine on the tobacco product retailer.
On the outer walls of the tobacco store it is prohibited to display any picture or visualization relating to tobacco products or smoking. As a result of these measures, purchasing tobacco products has become more difficult for young people.
Results of Youth Surveys in 2012 and 2013 The youth surveys in 2012 and 2013 were conducted within the WHO Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS). Respondents of the surveys were pupils in the 7th, 8th and 9th grades in the age group of 13-15.
In 2012 the rate of current – both daily and occasional – smokers was 27%; 31% of boys and 25% of girls smoked. This rate decreased by 3% in 2013. The decrease was observed among boys: the rate of current smokers among boys fell to 24% by 2013 and there was no change among girls.
In 2012, 7% of the age group of 13-15 were daily smokers, that is, 9% of boys and 5% of girls. The rate of current smokers among young people rose to 9% by 2013. The increase was 1% among boys and 2% among girls.
In 2012, 45% of young people bought cigarettes in shops; this rate decreased significantly to 20% by 2013. In 2012, 43% of young people were not prevented by shop assistants in 56 service from buying cigarettes because of their age, this rate unfortunately increased by 2013: 50% of the age group of 13-15 were not refused during service because of their age.
The Adult Tobacco Survey 2013 contains that 58% of the smokers said, that it is more or much more difficult to buy a tobacco product than before decreasing the number of the tobacco-selling places.
Four important measures on tobacco control implemented since 2012 in Hungary:
smoking ban in enclosed air space public places and in some of the open air space places, the significant tax increase on cigarettes, the warnings combined with pictures on cigarette packages and the drastic decrease in the number of stores selling tobacco products.
A significant decline of the prevalence among adults and slight decline of the prevalence among the youth occurred related to the four measures.
The reduction of the number of smokers is expected to help reduce tobacco related morbidity, mortality and tobacco related economic and social burden.
