"7","Australia","Report not provided","The tobacco industry has taken a number of actions to oppose Australia’s tobacco control agenda, particularly in relation to the world first tobacco plain packaging legislation.  

Imperial Tobacco Australia, Philip Morris Limited and British American Tobacco Australia ran large scale campaigns against the tobacco plain packaging measure using television, radio and print media advertising, social media, cards inserted into cigarette packs, and thousands of postcards sent to Members of Parliament. 

Australian Government departments have been inundated with freedom of information requests seeking access to documents relating to tobacco control and tobacco plain packaging. As at the time of submission of this report, the Department of Health had received 67 such requests since April 2010, including 53 from the tobacco industry. Handling these requests involves substantial staff and legal resources. 
 
The most significant difficulties Australia has faced since the introduction of plain packaging is, domestic and international litigation, in three separate fora, initiated by the industry to challenge the lawfulness of our measure. 
Domestically, the tobacco industry challenged the measure in Australia’s High Court in 2012.  The tobacco industry claimed the legislation contravened Australia’s Constitution on the basis that tobacco plain packaging constituted an acquisition of their property (including their intellectual property) by the Australian Government.
Australia was successful in the High Court, which ruled by majority, six judges to one, that the legislation was not contrary to the Australian Constitution.  

Australia has also faced international legal challenges in relation to the plain packaging measure.
The first was brought by Philip Morris Asia’s challenge to the measure under the investor-State dispute provisions of a Bilateral Investment Treaty between Australia and Hong Kong. On 18 December 2015, the Tribunal in this arbitration issued a decision unanimously agreeing with Australias position that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear Philip Morris’s claim.  

The challenge that is still afoot is the World Trade Organization (WTO) disputes brought by five countries - Ukraine, Honduras, Dominican Republic, Cuba and Indonesia.   In May 2015, the dispute settlement panel agreed to Ukraine’s request to suspend its proceedings against Australia with a view to finding a mutually agreed solution. Ukraine remains a third party to the disputes. The Panel has indicated that it does not expect to issue its final report to the parties before mid-2016.","The tobacco industry has taken a number of actions to oppose Australia''s tobacco control agenda. particularly in relation to the world first tobacco plain packaging legislation. 
Imperial Tobacco Australia. Philip Morris Limited and British American Tobacco Australia ran large scale campaigns against the tobacco plain packaging measure using television. radio and print media advertising. social media. cards inserted into cigarette packs. and thousands of postcards sent to Members of Parliament. 
Australian Government departments have been inundated with freedom of information requests seeking access to documents relating to tobacco control and tobacco plain packaging. As at the time of submission of this report. the Department of Health had received 67 such requests since April 2010. including 
53 from the tobacco industry. Handling these requests involves substantial staff and legal resources. 
The Australian Government has faced and is facing a number of legal challenges to the tobacco plain packaging measure. The Government is pursuing tobacco plain packaging as a public health measure and is confident that the measure is consistent with all its legal obligations. 
Constitutional Cases
British American Tobacco Australia. Japan Tobacco International. Philip Morris and Van Nelle challenged the constitutionality of the plain packaging legislation in the High Court of Australia. Two challenges were heard by the High Court of Australia on 17-19 April 2012. 
The British American Tobacco matter was heard on an agreed set of facts and questions reserved; the Japan Tobacco International matter also proceeded on those dates. on the basis of a demurrer. Philip Morris and Van Nelle intervened in the Britsh American Tobacco Australia matter.
On 15 August 2012. the High Court handed down orders for the matters heard on 17 19 April 2012. and found that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011(the TPP Act) is not contrary to s51(xxxi) of the Constitution. On 5 October 2012. the Court handed down its reasons for the decision.
–	By a 6:1 majority the Court held that there had been no acquisition of property that would have required provision of ''just terms'' under s51(xxxi) of the Constitution. Whilst the TPP Act does now regulate the plaintiff''s intellectual property rights to a greater extent than previously. imposing controls on the packaging and presentation of tobacco products. this does not amount to a conferral of a proprietary benefit or interest on the Commonwealth or any other person. Neither the Commonwealth nor any other person acquired any property and s51(xxxi) was not engaged. 
–	The British American Tobacco and Japan Tobacco International matters have now been concluded. Costs were awarded in favour of the Commonwealth.
