The Ministry has also successfully implemented smoke-free zones in three tertiary hospitals (Children’s Hospital, Connaught Hospital and Princess Christian Maternity Hospital), and through the involvement of respective student bodies, it has implemented smoke-free zones in two educational institutions: the Njala University and the Milton Margai College of Education and Technology.
The Attitudinal and Behavioural Change Secretariat of the Ministry of Information is working on creating smoke-free environments, particularly in the Yougi Building of the Government, which hosts several Government ministries. The code of conduct for employees of Statistics Sierra Leone forbids smoking within the premises of its offices.
Regarding children and young people, the Ministry of Education introduced a code of conduct for teachers stating that “no teacher can send a student to purchase cigarettes and teachers are not permitted to smoke on school grounds.”","Answer not provided","Answer not provided","WHO African Region"

Bajo este epígrafe se incorporan a los anteriores espacios libres de humo. eliminando la posibilidad de mantener espacios para fumadores. los bares. restaurantes. salas de fiesta. discotecas. locales de ocio. de juego y recreativos. puertos. aeropuertos. estaciones de trenes y autobuses.

"155","Sweden","All indoor public places are smoke-free including restaurants and bars. Designated smoking rooms are however permitted, but only if they are situated so that nobody has to pass through them in order to reach other parts of the premises. No serving is allowed in the smoking rooms. Smoking rooms must have adequate ventilation to ensure that pollutants from the smoking do not spread to other parts of the premises. Some areas do not have legal support to be qualified as non-smoking areas, but due to successful policies these areas are perceived as non-smoking areas. There is a notion that the law is ""complete"", when it is more accurate to say that it has contributed to a national standard stating that certain areas should be smoke-free 

The Public Health Agency of Sweden has been commissioned to investigate and analyze the presence of passive smoking in public areas and particularly where children are present. The commission also involved providing proposals for measures to further reduce passive smoking in these areas. As indoor smoking is currently already regulated by the law, the commission entailed focusing on outdoor public places.
