Se ha realizado seminarios y reuniones en las cuales se sensibiliza a los tomadores de decisión al respecto de las disposiciones del artículo 5.3 y sus directrices. 
En casos específicos se han remitido notas sobre la observancia del cumplimiento de las mismas. 
Estas recomendaciones se han efectuado con prioridad hacia las entidades con mayor grado de vinculación en la implementación de las diversas medidas establecidas en el CMCT.
En todas las acciones de capacitación dirigidas a personal de salud se incluye el tema de la interferencia de la industria tabacalera en las políticas de control de tabaco.

establecer medidas para limitar las interacciones con la industria tabacalera y presentar ejemplos de las que se hayan producido; 
En efecto se cuenta con una disposición que limita las interacciones de la Comisión Nacional para el Estudio del Tabaquismo con la industria tabacalera.

Rechazar las alianzas y los acuerdos/acuerdos voluntarios con la industria tabacalera que no sean vinculantes o de obligado cumplimiento; 
En Panamá no existe la práctica de acuerdos voluntarios con la industria tabacalera. 
En ocasiones previas a la ratificación del CMCT existieron algunos acuerdos que fueron revocados con la entrada en vigencia del CMCT (Yo tengo poder (MEDUCA – Despacho de la Primera Dama y el de las Granjas auto sostenibles con el Patronato de Nutrición. por ejemplo)

adoptar y aplicar un código de conducta para los funcionarios públicos. que prescriba las normas que deberían cumplir al tratar con la industria tabacalera. 
Mediante resolución de 745 de 16 de agosto de 2012 se establecieron medidas que limitan esta interacción a funcionarios del MINSA. las cuales se detallan.

No conceder incentivos. privilegios. ventajas o exenciones fiscales preferenciales a la industria tabacalera.

En la actualidad se cuenta en el MINSA con un equipo de abogadas especialistas en materia comercial y que están vigilantes que en las negociaciones actuales no se otorguen beneficios de ninguna índole a la industria del tabaco.
Tenemos pendiente examinar la cuestión de los acuerdos previos para ver las formas posibles de eliminar dichas disposiciones.

Hay alguna industria tabacalera de propiedad estatal que lleve a cabo actividades en su jurisdicción y cómo se separan las funciones de supervisión de la industria tabacalera de propiedad estatal de la formulación de políticas de control del tabaco en el ámbito gubernamental. según proceda. 
En Panamá no se producen productos de tabaco por ninguna empresa estatal
