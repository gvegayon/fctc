"150","Spain","Report not provided","En España, se pueden distinguir medidas de protección del medio ambiente en los siguientes ámbitos:
*	Dentro del primer pilar de la política agraria comunitaria (PAC): 
En el marco de los pagos directos, la última reforma de la PAC da una mayor importancia a la sostenibilidad medioambiental de la agricultura dentro del primer pilar de la PAC, en la UE. 
Así, esta nueva PAC dentro de los pagos directos, ha introducido un nuevo pago denominado “Pago para prácticas agrícolas beneficiosas para el clima y el medio ambiente” (conocida comúnmente como “greening” o “pago verde”). Este pago es obligatorio para los agricultores y cuenta con una dotación presupuestaria de un 30% del sobre nacional de cada Estado miembro, de la UE, dentro de los pagos directos. Se concede un pago anual por cada hectárea admisible, siempre que se respeten determinadas prácticas medioambientales, dependiendo de la estructura de la explotación. Así, los agricultores con derecho a un pago en virtud del “régimen de pago básico” deben respetar dichas prácticas en todas las hectáreas de su explotación.
Se consideran prácticas beneficiosas para el clima y el medio ambiente: la diversificación de cultivos, el mantenimiento de los pastos permanentes existentes y contar con superficies de interés ecológico en la explotación (barbecho, superficies dedicadas a cultivos fijadores de nitrógeno, superficies forestadas y superficies dedicadas a agrosilvicultura). Estas prácticas de “greening” buscan mejorara el comportamiento ambiental y de cara al cambio climático de las explotaciones.
Al tratarse el tabaco de un cultivo en tierra arable, le afecta el cumplimiento de la diversificación de cultivos y de las superficies de interés ecológico, que el agricultor deberá respectar en función de la estructura de su explotación. En concreto, estas dos prácticas van dirigidas directamente a la mejora del suelo y a la biodiversidad, con efectos también en lo que tiene que ver con la mitigación del cambio climático.
*	Dentro del segundo pilar de la PAC: 
En Extremadura (principal región productora de tabaco en España, con el 95,38% de la producción total), en el marco de su PDR, existe una medida agroambiental que favorece la producción integrada de tabaco, haciendo este cultivo más sostenible desde el punto de vista medioambiental.
Por otro lado, se hace control de la implantación de las regulaciones sobre salud laboral y sobre protección al medio ambiente en el entorno laboral.","Answer not provided","WHO European Region"
