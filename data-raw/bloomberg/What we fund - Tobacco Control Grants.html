            <p>This project aims to persuade and support the South African government to make important reforms to the tobacco taxation regime to make tobacco less affordable, and to ensure that hard-won amendments to comprehensive tobacco control legislation are fully effective as regulations are adopted and implemented.

            <h4>National Council Against Smoking</h4>
            <p>The project aims to support, the South African government to make important reforms to tobacco control legislation. In particular, we will work with the National Department of Health (NDoH) to amend the Tobacco Products Control Act,1993, so as to provide for 100% smokefree indoor public places, to make provision for plain packaging, the regulation of e-cigarettes and to otherwise strengthen the Act. We will also support the NDoH in adopting and implementing effective new regulations once the Act is amended. To ensure the future sustainability of tobacco control the project will motivate for, and support, the establishment of a health promotion foundation funded through a surcharge on tobacco and alcohol. Adherence to WHO FCTC Article 5.3 Guidelines by government and MPs will be promoted to counter tobacco industry interference with tobacco control policies.  South Africa is a model for other African countries and this project will ensure that significant progress continues to be made now and into the future.</p>
